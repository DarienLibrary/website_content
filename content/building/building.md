## Building History
Over the last 100+ years, Darien Library has existed in four locations.

2009-Present  1441 Post Road

The current building was funded over a 10 year capitol campaign. Our strong community support meant that we were too popular for our former small building. Seeing the need for more space, the motto "Once in a lifetime a community builds a library" resonated with residents to back the initiative. Our long-term director at that time, Louise Parker Berry, and [need Alan's title from then] Alan Kirk Gray, developed a strategy with the Library board to raise funds and support for the new building. 

The Library was designed by architect Peter Gisolfi of Peter Gisolfi Associates from Hastings-on-Hudson, NY. His expertise resulted in a 54,000 square foot building. The building's design is meant to feel solid and long lasting while the big windows add light and an airiness to the structure. An achievement of Gisolfi's work is that the Library is Gold LEED certified for environmental sustainability. It was the first library in New England to meet these high standards. 

Surrounding the building is native foliage. A fountain (?) and patio are located between the parking lot and entrance as a relaxing warm weather treat. In cold weather, children often stop to toss snowballs into the empty pool. On summer nights, there may be concerts or astronomy viewing programs to enjoy.

We opened at the current location on January 10, 2009. On opening day, we welcomed 7,200 patrons to see their new library. Since then, we see XXX,XXX visits each year. The Library is open 69 (?) hours per week to meet the community's needs.

Aside from the everyday use of the Library, after severe weather, we open our doors for longer hours to be a shelter and safe place for our community.
