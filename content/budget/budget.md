#Budget Summary
The Libraryâ€™s budget proposal for fiscal year 2015-2016 calls for expenditures of $3,506,220, an increase of $23,038, or 0.7%.

The budget makes provision for a 3% increase in staff and administrative salaries.

Library and Building operating accounts increase by $15,246, with increases in Electricity, Gas and Fuel, Insurance and Audit Expenses partially offset by decreases in Building Operations and Maintenance and Service.

In accordance with guidance from the Town, we have budgeted a 3.2% decrease in Retirement, and we have budgeted an increase of 15% for Workers
Comp and Property and Liability Insurance. Because Darien Library was able to negotiate a significant reduction in Health Insurance costs for the current year by switching carriers and changing terms, we are able to show a decrease in Health Insurance costs for next year, despite a projected 15% increase. The overall reduction in Health, Insurance and Retirement is $54,225.

These, and other actions, are detailed later in this report.
