The Annual Fund is a crucial ingredient of our success, since these funds are added to the operating income we generously receive from the Town. Your donations go directly to the purchase of all of the books, movies, and technology as well as the support of countless programming opportunities throughout the year, making Darien Library the intellectual and cultural heart of Darien. 

Please give to Darien Library today. 


Any donation amount is appreciated.
