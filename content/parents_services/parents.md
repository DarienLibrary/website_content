### Parenting Collection and Programs
Children don't come with instructions, but that doesn't mean you have to raise your child alone. We have [books and videos](/link-needed "Parenting Books and Videos") to help you get through those early days, the tantrums, all the way up to the Birds and the Bees. 

We also offer programs throughout the year to address common childhood issues. [View upcoming programs](/link-needed "View upcoming parenting programs").

### 100 Before One
The Children’s Library invites all parents of newborns to join the [100 Before One](/100-before-one "100 Before One") challenge. Help your baby become a lifelong reader by joining the challenge and reading 100 books before your baby’s first birthday. Parents that register their babies for 100 Before One will receive a free tote bag, booklists, a DVD of baby rhymes, a Highlights baby magazine, and a folder to keep track of the books your child has heard.
