### Audiobooks

We offer audiobooks in three formats: as CDs, MP3 Playaways (for children), and digital eAudiobooks. Most of the audiobooks are located on the Main Level in front of the Frosty Bear Cafe. Children’s audiobooks and Playaways are located within the Children’s Library on the left when you come in the door. Digital eAudiobooks can be downloaded from our [digital collection](/catalog/search/keyword?search=%2A&formats=eaudiobook "Download eAudiobooks").

### Digital Books

eBooks allow the reader to resize the text to a more comfortable reading size. You may access eBooks on your computer or on a mobile device. Just visit the app store and download the OverDrive and 3M Cloud Library apps. You will need your Darien Library card.

The Large Print Books collection is located on the Main Level [by the fireplace](/link-needed "Map to Fireplace"). The books include popular fiction and non-fiction. Digital books’ text size can be changed, so ask at the Front Desk about eBooks.

### Magnifier with Screen

The portable magnifier magnifies text onto a 7-inch screen. The new tool is easy to use, and can assist readers in several different ways. Place it on the document or hold it over the document and follow the text with a little camera. Ask for this device at the Reference Desk on the Second Level.
