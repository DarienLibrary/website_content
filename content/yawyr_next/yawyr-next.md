Wondering what to read next? Darien Library is here for you!

Answer the following questions (which generally takes between 5 - 10 minutes) and a Readers' Advisory Librarian will send you a list of 5 books you might enjoy.  The form is intended to describe what you are looking for right now rather than capture your overall identity as a reader. Have fun with it!

Because we like to keep things interesting, Darien Library includes a Wildcard Read in our list of books; usually a book that we love too much not to share. Be sure to let us know what you think as we are always striving to improve our recommendations.
