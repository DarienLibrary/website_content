### Questions about Book Groups

**What are Books in a Bag?**<br />
Books in a Bag are bags of 10 books with a reader's guide that your book group can check out for six weeks.

**Can my book group register with the Library?**<br />
Yes! Just [register online](/bookgroups-register "Register your book group"). One or more members of your book group needs to be a resident of Darien. Books in a bag are available only to book groups that are registered with us. 

**Can I request a title for a Books in a Bag?**<br />
Yes! We ask that you work with us at least two weeks before your group needs the book.

**But we really want to read the hottest bestseller!**<br /> 
While we try to maintain a current collection of hot books, if you do not see what you are looking for, [please ask](mailto:bookgroups@darienlibrary.org "Email Book Groups")!

**Can my child join a book group?**<br />
Your child can start their own book club with one of our starter kits. Check out the books for:
* [First to Third Graders](https://dar.to/2Bbe59v "First to Third Graders")
* [Fourth to Sixth Graders](https://dar.to/2BbFXKo "Fourth to Sixth Graders")
