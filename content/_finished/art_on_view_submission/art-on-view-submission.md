Due to current COVID restrictions, Darien Library’s Art on View is hosted on the Library’s [Instagram account](https://dar.to/2lr3pGT "Instagram account"). The Library selects “Featured Artists” to showcase digitally on our social media channel. Our desire is to offer the community an opportunity to benefit from viewing various forms of art and to support local artists. 

The Art Committee of Darien Library meets on an ongoing basis to review the work of interested artists. To submit artwork for consideration as an Instagram “Featured Artist,” please fill out the submission form below. A member of our art committee will contact you.

### Publicity
At least one month in advance of the exhibit date, the artist should send current biographical information and a short write-up about the artwork in the show to [Cathy McLachlan](/mailto:cmclachlan@darienlibrary.org "Send email to Cathy McLachlan") at the Library. Digital pictures of works that will be in the show are useful for press releases and should also be sent at least four weeks in advance. The exhibit will be promoted on the Library website and in the local newspapers.
<br />
<br />

### Price List and Sales
The artist will provide a list of the works to be exhibited with the retail price, which includes the six percent Connecticut sales tax.  The list cannot be displayed on the walls but will be available at the Reference and Welcome desks for interested patrons. The artist is the Seller; therefore, a Buyer makes payment directly to the artist. The artist is then responsible for submitting the sales tax to the state.
<br />
<br />

### Commission
The artist agrees to give the Library 20 percent of the total sales from the show or from any work sold as a result of the show. 
<br />
<br />

### Hanging
The artist, along with a committee member and if possible a person accompanying the artist, will hang the show. The committee member will make any final decisions regarding which works are exhibited. If more than one artist is involved in the show, the committee member will have final say as to where artwork is hung. The artist will deliver the paintings to the Library on a date and time agreed upon with a member of the Art Committee.

### Labeling
If labels are desired, the artist should provide them. Please clearly label all artwork with a title and/or a number that corresponds to the price list. The Committee is not responsible if errors occur on sales because of incorrectly labeled art work. 

Library Recommendation: Use a computer label format like [Avery labels 8871](http://www.avery.com/avery/en_us/Templates-%26-Software/Templates/Cards/Business-Cards/Business-Card-_-Wide-10-per-sheet_Microsoft-Word.htm "Avery Labels") or another label which is white matte, has no perforations, and then print out on a sheet of "Extra-sturdy, coated business cards" (available at Staples). Then apply double-sided tape to the back, which adheres well to the walls.
<br />
<br />

### Insurance
Darien Library is insured; however, we do require artists to sign a Release form. 
<br />
<br />

### Reception
The artist has the option to hold a reception at the Library on a Friday evening. The artist will contact [Cathy McLachlan](/mailto:cmclachlan@darienlibrary.org "Send email to Cathy McLachlan") or call [203-669-5220](tel:2036695220 "Call Cathy"), to determine a date that is compatible with the Library’s schedule. The artist will provide refreshments, tablecloths, serving utensils, etc., and will be responsible for cleaning up. Library will provide folding tables.
<br />
<br />

### Takedown
The artist will pick up artwork from the library on the date agreed upon with the committee. The work will stay on exhibit for the entire show. The artist will take the show down.
