### For Adults
We are actively looking for volunteers to help capture records for our Obituaries Index Project. This is a perfect opportunity for someone who would like to participate in a community-wide legacy service. The ideal candidate will pay attention to detail and have an interest in the town’s history. Volunteers will be able to set their own hours.

Please contact Colleen Wood at [cwood@darienlibrary.org](mailto:cwood@darienlibrary.org "Email Colleen Wood") for further information.!
