<h2>About Dr. Singh</h2>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-5">

<p style="font-size:1.1em !important;">Dr. Simran Jeet Singh is an award-winning educator, activist, and scholar who speaks regularly on diversity, equity, and inclusion. He facilitates workshops on these topics for a variety of audiences, from preschools to university campuses, and from local community centers to corporate boardrooms.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.1em !important;">Simran is also the host of the new show, <a href="http://dar.to/382Jfgw">Becoming Less Racist: Lighting a Path to Anti-Racism</a>, as well as the podcast <a href="http://dar.to/3qYaMst">Spirited</a>, which explores how leaders from marginalized groups think about and navigate justice work.</p>

</div>
<div class="col-md-4">

<p style="font-size:1.1em !important;">While he is an accomplished professor with graduate degrees from Harvard and Columbia, Simran uses personal stories, dad-jokes, and a love for pop culture to connect with people where they are.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.1em !important;">Thatâ€™s because he understands that marginalized groups will not lecture their way into dignity and that empathy is really built when we connect with one another as human beings.</p>
