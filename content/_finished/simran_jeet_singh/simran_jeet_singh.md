<h3>Tuesday, January 26th at 7 p.m.</h3>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-5">

<p style="font-size:1.1em !important;">Darien Library along with nine community partners are proud to present a special lecture by an award-winning educator, activist, and scholar, Dr. Simran Jeet Singh.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.1em !important;">Can you imagine what it feels like to be so invisible that people don’t even know who you are? Now imagine how empowering it would be, after decades of being invisible, to finally see yourself publicly represented. So much of Dr. Singh’s work has centered around increasing visibility of Sikhs, not just to build community power, but also as a matter of survival. Dr. Singh will share accounts of his trailblazing efforts and historic firsts in diverse fields – such as children’s literature, podcasting, and chaplaincy – as a way of illustrating the power of representation, and why it matters so much to so many.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.1em !important;">Seats are limited for this one of a kind event.</p>
