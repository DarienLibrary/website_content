<div class="row-fluid privacy">

Because we understand how important it is that our patrons know what will happen to any personal information provided by them to us, the Darien Library is committed to policies intended to prevent the unauthorized use of our patrons’ personal information, and to protect the privacy of this information. The American Library Association’s Code of Ethics states: “We protect each library user's right to privacy and confidentiality with respect to information sought or received and resources consulted, borrowed, acquired or transmitted.” Moreover, Section 11-25(b) of the Connecticut General Statutes protects the confidentiality of personally identifiable information contained in the circulation records of all public libraries.
<br/>
<br/>

The intent of this statement is to set forth our policy on our treatment of patrons’ personal information.
<br/>
<br/>

<h4><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i> 
What information does the Darien Library collect and how is it used?</h4>

We attempt to collect and maintain only those records of our patrons necessary for us to provide services consistent with our mission statement.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<h4><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i> Does the Darien Library disclose the information it collects to outside parties?</h4>

No! The Darien Library does not resell or disseminate any information obtained from our patrons to third parties.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<h4><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i> Why does the Darien Library need my email address?</h4>

We may contact you by email to provide you with information concerning the Library’s services or to remind you that Library material, checked out by you, is overdue. Should you wish not to receive emails from us, please advise us by email. We will respect your wishes in regard to the methods we use to communicate with you.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<h4><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i> How does the Darien Library protect personal information?</h4>

We use our technology to keep personal information secure from unauthorized access.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<h4><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i> Do these same policies apply to non-Library Web sites that I access through the Darien Library?</h4>

We cannot be responsible for the privacy and security practices of non-Library Web sites. You will notice that our Web site may contain links to other sites such as Darien community services. While we believe these sites share a similar commitment to user privacy and security, you should review each site’s privacy and security policies as a precaution.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<h4><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i> How does the USA Patriot Act of 2001 affect this Policy Statement?</h4>

The USA PATRIOT ACT expands the authority of the federal government to conduct investigations of individuals in the interests of national security. The enactment of this law increases the possibility that the activities of library patrons, including their use of computers to browse the Web or access email, could be under government surveillance without their knowledge or consent. Public libraries face the dilemma of
seeking to protect the privacy of their patrons, on one hand, while responding to national security concerns and legal requirements, on the other. The Darien Library intends to do its best to balance these competing concerns.

The Library Director, and/or any person duly appointed by the Library Director or the Board of Trustees, shall be responsible for handling all law enforcement or similar requests for information concerning our patrons. In the event of a request for personal information, the Library Director shall immediately consult with legal counsel to determine if such request is in proper form and to formulate an appropriate response. Library staff shall immediately refer all law enforcement inquiries to the Library Director, or such other person appointed by the Board of Trustees, and shall not release any personal information until authorized by the Library Director or the duly appointed designee.

If the agent or officer requesting such information does not have a subpoena, warrant or court order compelling the production of the information, the Library Director shall explain the Library’s privacy policy and inform the agent or officer that the information is not available without the production of a valid subpoena, warrant or court order. If the agent or officer produces a subpoena, warrant or court order, the Library Director shall immediately refer it to legal counsel for review. Based upon advice of legal
counsel, the Library Director will release the requested information if presented with a legally issued subpoena, warrant or court order.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<h4><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i> How does the Darien Library update its Privacy and Security Policy?</h4>

The Darien Library Board of Trustees reserves the right to amend this Policy at any time. Any changes to our Privacy and Security Policy will be posted on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect and how we use it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
