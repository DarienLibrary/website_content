* Either the tutor, or the client, or both, must be a resident of Darien.
* All tutoring must take place in the Fiction section or by the Caf√© on the First Floor of the Library, except by prior written agreement. Tutors are expected to restrict their use of space to an acceptable minimum, and observe all Library regulations. 
* Library staff will enforce the procedures as necessary, and will require tutors to move immediately if they are observed tutoring in other areas.
