The Children's Library has three [Tween Tabs](https://www.darienlibrary.org/catalog/work/51230) available for checkout with your library card. The kits come pre-loaded with selected apps geared towards children 8 to 12. The apps are organized into the folders that mirror our Non-fiction section. As we discover great new apps, we will update the iPad kits periodically.

For younger children, borrow our [Early Literacy iPads](/early-literacy-ipads "Early Literacy iPads") or [Elementary iPads](/elementary-ipads "Elementary iPads").

Here is the current list of apps you will find installed on Darien Library's Tween Tabs:
