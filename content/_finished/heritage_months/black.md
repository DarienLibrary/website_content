### History of Black History Month
The United States celebrates Black History Month (also known as African American Heritage Month) in the month of February each year. The celebration originated with historian [Dr. Carter G. Woodson](https://dar.to/2Rxt1lx "Dr. Carter G. Woodson") in 1926 who called for a week of recognition. 

President Gerald Ford said in 1976 for the [first national observation](https://dar.to/3AJG5wf "First National Observation"), "...we can seize the opportunity to honor the too-often neglected accomplishments of Black Americans in every area of endeavor throughout our history." 

The [National Museum of African American History & Culture](https://dar.to/3rUaGTJ "National Museum of African American History & Culture") was established in 2003, opened in 2016, and is located in Washington, D.C.
