Every day we appreciate having opportunities to connect people with stories that reflect their own experiences. Darien is a better place to call home thanks to our Native American neighbors, colleagues, and friends. The Library celebrates year-round the vibrant cultural heritage of indigenous people. We are honored to be part of the continuous process of building a more inclusive community together.

### History of Native American Heritage Month
The United States celebrates Native American Heritage Month from November 1st through November 30th each year. President George H.W. Bush said in 1990, "Long before European explorers set foot on the North American continent, this great land has been cultivated and cherished by generations of American Indians" ([Proclamation 6230](https://dar.to/3cbVFFi "Proclaimation 6230"). Bush also signed the National Museum of the American Indian Act in 1989 for the founding of a new Smithsonian museum in Washington, D.C.
