### History of AAPI Heritage Month
The United States celebrates Asian Pacific American Heritage Month in May each year. The month-long celebration highlights the AAPI's community "significant role in the creation of a dynamic and pluralistic America, with their enormous contributions to our science, arts, industry, government and commerce" ([Proclamation 4650](https://dar.to/2RBKO0y "Proclaimation 4650") by President Jimmy Carter, 1979). The celebration was then extended to a month in 1990 by President George H.W. Bush via [Public Law 101-283](https://dar.to/3hneBom "Public Law 101-283"). 

Visit Darien Library though the month of May to view our APPI Heritage Month book displays. Read the Library's [Statement on Anti-Asian Violence](https://dar.to/3f7Th5q "Statement on Anti-Asian Violence").
