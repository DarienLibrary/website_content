Every day we appreciate having opportunities to connect people with stories that reflect their own experiences. Darien is a better place to call home thanks to our Latin American neighbors, colleagues, and friends. The Library celebrates year-round the vibrant cultural heritage of Latin American members. We are honored to be part of the continuous process of building a more inclusive community together.

### History of Hispanic Heritage Month
The United States celebrates Hispanic Heritage Month from September 15th through October 15th each year. "It is with special pride that I call the attention of my fellow citizens to the great contribution to our national heritage made by our people of Hispanic descent" ([Proclamation 3869](https://dar.to/2VVDCyn "Proclaimation 4650") by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968). The celebration was then extended to a month in 1989 by President George H.W. Bush in [Proclamation 6021](https://dar.to/3BtKfs0 "Proclamation 6021").
