### What's a Farm Share?
You may have heard of a vegetable box or farm share before. CSA stands for Community Supported Agriculture¬ù and it means community members get together to invest in a farm during the winter or early Spring and then when the harvest season rolls out, they pick up a weekly package of vegetables at a designated pick-up location.

<br />

### Pickup at Darien Library
In 2019, Darien Library will once again be the pickup location for [Stoneledge Farm's CSA](https://dar.to/2EWPYJt "Stoneledge Farm's CSA"). The farm share pickup will be every Wednesday evening from 4:30 to 7:30 p.m. running from June 5th until November 13th (24 weeks).

To take part, sign up for a vegetable share. Then you can add a fruit, mushroom, and/or coffee share to your order too.

The vegetables are grown locally so they are fresher than anything you'll find in a grocery store, and incredibly varied.

### Split a Farm Share
There is the option to split a share. When you sign up and add the share to your cart, provide your share partner's name, phone number, and email address.
<br />
<br />

### Volunteer for Two Hours
As a member of the CSA, you will be asked to complete two hours of volunteer work during the season. Volunteers do things like check people in when they pick up their share, make sure the vegetables are replenished, or move boxes.
