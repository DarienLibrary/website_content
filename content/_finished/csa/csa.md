### What's a Farm Share?
You may have heard of a vegetable box or farm share before. CSA stands for Community Supported Agriculture and it means community members get together to invest in a farm during the winter or early Spring and then when the harvest season rolls out, they pick up a weekly package of vegetables at a designated pick-up location.
<br />
<br />

### Pickup at Darien Library
In 2021, Darien Library will once again be the pickup location for [Stoneledge Farm's CSA](https://dar.to/2EWPYJt "Stoneledge Farm's CSA"). The farm share pickup will be every Wednesday evening from 4:30 to 7:30 p.m. running from June 9th until November 17th (24 weeks).

The Farm is going to be holding outside pickups starting **Wednesday, June 9th** from 4:30 to 7:30 p.m. in Darien Library's parking lot. The building will not be open. Volunteers will distribute the food to CSA members during pick-up. The veggies and shares will be boxed up in reusable waxy coated boxes.
<br />
<br />

To take part, sign up for a vegetable share. Then you can add a fruit, mushroom, and/or coffee share to your order too.
