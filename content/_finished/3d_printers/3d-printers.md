A 3D printer is a machine that takes digital files and produces a plastic print-out of your design. The arrival of 3D printers allows anyone to create physical models of their own designs without the need to send out to a special manufacturer. [Learn more](http://www.3dprinter.net/reference/what-is-3d-printing "Learn more about 3D Printers") about 3D printers. Objects printed with our 3D printers may not be suitable for all applications, such as coming in contact with food, beverages, and consumable products. Please do not place objects in dishwashers, microwaves, or aquariums. If you would like to see a 3D printer, come down to the Help Desk located in the computer labs on the Lower Level.

This exciting new technology will continue to improve in the years to come. Therefore when you request an object to be printed, please keep in mind that sometimes the machines will be unavailable due to repairs.

### 3D Objects

3D objects can be downloaded from a site like [Thingiverse](http://thingiverse.com "Thingiverse"). While staff members are unable to show you how to create designs, you can teach yourself using our access to [Lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com/portal/sip?org=darienlibrary.org "Lynda.com").

#### Design Your Own 3D Object

* [Tinkercad](http://tinkercad.com/ "Tinkercad")
* [SketchUp](http://www.sketchup.com/ "Sketch")


#### Locations of Printers

* [Digital Media Lab](/dml "Digital Media Lab") (DML) on the Lower Level

### Cost to Print

We charge by weight in grams. We will give you an estimate of how much the final object will cost before we print. The weight of the [supports and rafts](https://www.simplify3d.com/support/tutorials/rafts-skirts-and-brims/ "Supports and rafts") are included in the cost. Therefore, we cannot give an exact cost at the time of the print order. 

Children who live in Darien and are 12 and under may use the 3D printer in the Children's Library at no cost.

* 10¢ per gram
* Minimum charge: $2
