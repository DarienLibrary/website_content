The internet provides access to a wealth of information that is personally, professionally, and culturally enriching to individuals of all ages. Internet access to material of a controversial or mature nature, as well as to material that is not accurate, complete, or current, is unavoidable.

Darien Library does not filter information on the internet, except in the Children’s Library. The computers located in the Children’s Library are reserved for the use of children under the supervision of a parent or guardian. Public computers in the Children’s Library are filtered at the network level, however the Library recognizes that filtering is not a completely reliable means of protection from materials that may be offensive, controversial or illegal. Parents are expected to monitor and supervise their children's internet sessions.

Use of Darien Library's internet connection for illegal, inappropriate, or obscene purposes or in support of such activities is prohibited and may be reported to law enforcement authorities.

Materials obtained or copied on the internet may be subject to copyright laws which govern the making of reproductions of copyrighted works.

Library patrons use the public computers and the internet at their own risk.
