The Darien High School internship application process generally begins in early January. When we have confirmed the timeline and parameters of the 2017 process with the high school, we will post an application here, and students will be given several weeks to apply. If you have any questions in the meantime, please [email Stephanie Anderson](mailto:sanderson@darienlibrary.org "Email Stephanie Anderson").
