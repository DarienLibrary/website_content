The Children’s Library invites all parents of newborns to join the 100 Before One challenge. Help your baby become a lifelong reader by joining the challenge and reading 100 books before your baby’s first birthday. As related recently in a [New York Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/24/us/pediatrics-group-to-recommend-reading-aloud-to-children-from-birth.html?_r=0), the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends reading to infants starting from birth to aid in brain development and vocabulary growth.

Parents that register their babies for 100 Before One will receive a free tote bag, booklists, a DVD of baby rhymes, a Highlights baby magazine, and a folder to keep track of the books your child has heard.  After reading and listening to 25 books of your choice, parents return to Darien Library to receive their next blank list of 25 to fill in.

Upon completion of the program, your baby will get to go home with a prize courtesy of the Library.
