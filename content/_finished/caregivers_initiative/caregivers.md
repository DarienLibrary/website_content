### About the Caregiver Initiative
Darien Library is proposing to launch a Caregiver Initiative. This year-long series of events is designed to provide respite and community support to caregivers of adult residents who are aging in place, especially those with Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia. The series will consist of a kick-off keynote event followed by monthly Caregiver Cafés.

#### Caregiver Café Events
The monthly one-hour Caregiver Cafés will be open to local caregivers and the adults they care for. This café series will function as a way for caregivers to find a community of like-minded individuals with whom to share stories and experiences while their loved ones are guided through stimulating activities and crafts. In addition to opportunities to relax and network, the café will offer guided virtual reality field trips and stress-relieving workshops.
