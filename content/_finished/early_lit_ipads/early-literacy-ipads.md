The Children's Library has four [Early Literacy iPads](/catalog/work/94235 "Early Literacy iPads") available for checkout. The kits come pre-loaded with selected apps geared towards children 5 and under. The apps were specially selected for their early literacy skill-building qualities, and are organized into categories that are vital to early literacy: read, write, talk, sing and play. As we discover great new apps, we will update the iPad kits periodically.  

Here is the current list of apps you will find installed on Darien Library's Early Literacy iPads:
