Aloha!

My name is Tori Ogawa and I was born and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii on the island of Oahu.  I love working with kids and reading books, so becoming a children’s librarian at Darien Library is my dream come true.

I enjoy hiking, going to the beach, and just being outdoors. But, I also really like baking yummy treats and watching a good movie or TV show. After traveling abroad to Europe, I caught the travel bug and love exploring the world. I hope to visit every continent in my lifetime. I also have a weakness for great food and am always looking for new restaurants and places to try!

As a kid, reading was my favorite thing to do. Two of my favorites when I was growing up were The Giving Tree and Rainbow Fish. Now, I love reading all kinds of books, but books with magic or twists on fairy tales are definitely some of my top choices. Some of my favorites to read are The Three Ninja Pigs and The Harry Potter series.

Being from a warm and tropical place, I am most looking forward to the different seasons of Connecticut. I am so excited to see the leaves change color in the fall, so I can jump in a gigantic pile of orange and red leaves. I am also looking forward to seeing the snow fall and getting to build a snowman and make snow angels in winter. Also, being from an island means I had to catch a plane to travel anywhere off the island. So I definitely am looking forward to being able to take road trips and catching trains to visit different states.
