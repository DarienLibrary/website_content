We will do our best to fulfill interlibrary loans requests for Darien residents , those who work full-time in Darien, and [Friends of the Library](/friends "Friends of the Library"). If you live outside of Darien, please see your hometown library's website for their interlibrary loan services.

If your item was published within the last year, please use the [suggest a purchase form](/suggest-purchase "Suggest a purchase form").

To use the Interlibrary Loan service, your Darien Library account must have no outstanding fines. Limit of five requests at a time.
