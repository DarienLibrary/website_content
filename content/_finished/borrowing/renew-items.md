### Online
[Vist your Library account](https://dar.to/3gUzs0B "Visit your Library account") on our website. Check off the items you'd like to renew and then click **Renew Selected.** 

If there is no checkbox next to the item, this means that someone else has already requested it and therefore it cannot be renewed. 

After you've returned the material, place another hold on it so you can check it out when it's available again!
