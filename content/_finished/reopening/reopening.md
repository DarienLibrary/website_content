Darien Library is open to visitors normal hours. Some of our programs are now available in-person outdoors. Most events continue to be held virtually. Marks are required at all times while in the building and must fully cover your mouth and nose at all times.
<br />

We do not have a date when full services and in-person programs will resume. The health and safety of our community and patrons is our top priority and we will continue to abide by federal, state, and local regulations and guidance.
