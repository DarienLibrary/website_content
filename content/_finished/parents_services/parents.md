### Parenting Collection and Programs
Children don't come with instructions, but that doesn't mean you have to raise your child alone. We have [books and videos](/catalog/search/keyword?search=parenting "Parenting Books and Videos") to help you get through those early days, the tantrums, all the way up to the Birds and the Bees. We support early literacy in pre-readers with special services and programs for them.

We also offer programs throughout the year to address common childhood issues. [View upcoming programs](/events/calendar/kids/ "View upcoming parenting programs")
