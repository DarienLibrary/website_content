Wee Burn Country Club<br />
410 Hollow Tree Ridge Rd, Darien, CT

A. J. Finn has written for numerous publications, including the _Los Angeles Times_, the _Washington Post_, and the _Times Literary Supplement_. Finn’s debut novel, [_The Woman in the Window_](https://dar.to/2zbCp4Q "The Woman in the Window"), has been sold in thirty-eight territories worldwide and is in development as a major motion picture from Fox 2000 Studios. A native of New York, Finn lived in England for ten years before returning to New York City.

Sponsor and Benefactor Tables are currently available for purchase, and single tickets will be on sale pending availability in February. **New this year** – the Sponsor Table will have A.J. Finn seated at their table!

All guests of the Sponsor Table and Benefactor Tables will attend a “meet and greet” pre-reception with A.J. Finn from 11:30 to 12 noon, and receive a signed copy of _The Woman in the Window_. Each table seats 10 people.

Single tickets will be on sale pending availability in February. Check back here for updates!
