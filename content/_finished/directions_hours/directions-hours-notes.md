Needs a photo of the Library. Current image: http://www.darienlibrary.org/sites/darienlibrary.org/files/imagecache/medium/userimg/16889/Darien_Library_image2.jpg

Is there a more attractive way to show how the text should be laid out? Maybe with cute icons on the left of a train with directions on the right. Two column layout for Automobile, Bus, Train
