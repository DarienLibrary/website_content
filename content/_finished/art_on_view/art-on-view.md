#### About the Artist
Darien Public School Teachers/ Artists are excited to show again at Darien Library. The department has a long history and commitment to being working artists  and teaching art.  This show is a variety of mediums and styles displaying our unique interests and artistic backgrounds. We are excited to welcome three new teachers to our department this year, Malory Consonery (Tokeneke), Chris Skaggs (DHS) and Lauren Stelluti (DHS). We hope you enjoy the show and come back in April for our K-12 Student Art Show.
