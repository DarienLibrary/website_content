#### About the Show
Darien artist Amy Schott won Best in Show with a mixed media entry, Salzburg Swallows at the Darien Art Center’s 58th Darien Art Show & Sale, which kicked off with a packed gallery at their opening reception on June 2. The DAC, received 244 entries from 157 artists from kindergarten age to adult. 
 
This year’s judge, Arianne Faber Kolb, Ph.D., commented, “It was a great pleasure judging the Darien Art Show, which features such a range of artistic talent, from established local artists to students of all ages working in a variety of media. It is challenging at times to award prizes, since the artworks are different in approaches and styles yet equally deserving of recognition. This wonderfully diverse show has something for everyone: contemplative abstract works, landscapes, portraits, still lifes, and whimsical cows! I particularly applaud the student artists who submitted their work to this show and I look forward to seeing these budding talents continue to pursue their creative interests.”

This year’s show featured 14 categories and 42 winners. All adult first-, second- and third-place winners will be on display at Darien Library.

Adult first place winners included Kaz Oda for Oil, Joyce Grasso for Acrylic, Adriana Robles for Color Photography, Sophie Cirillo for Black and White Photography, Christina Klumb for Sculpture, Sandra Aldrich for Watercolor, Meg Tweedy for Mixed Media and Dana Goodfellow for Drawing, Pastel and Graphics.
