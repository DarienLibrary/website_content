### About the Artist
Artist Joanne Gray grew up on the coastal south west shores of Cornwall England. Surrounded by white sand and the turquoise sea she fell in love with anything and everything nautical.

Salt water fish rubbings was born in 2011 after a trip to the islands where she stumbled upon a local Gyotaku artist. She was inspired and began studying the Japanese technique ‘Gyotaku’.

Gyotaku, or Japanese fish printing, was originally used to record and commemorate a fisherman’s catch. Prints were made using Sumi ink and Rice paper. This original form of Gyotaku, as a recording method for fisherman, It is the original methodology. The fish is cleaned, prepped, supported, and then inked. At this point, rice paper is applied to the fish, and an image is created by careful hand rubbing or pressing.

Over the past eight years, Joanne has received awards and recognition from international design and media outlets as well as interior design blogs and currently is selling her limited edition pieces with Serena & Lily in their Artist collection. Joanne Lives in Norwalk with her husband and two sons and has a charming shop on the water in Rowayton.
