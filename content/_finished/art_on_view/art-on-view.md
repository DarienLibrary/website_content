#### About the Artist
Born into a culture of artists, in New York, art was the fabric of her family. She went on to study Business and Marketing at Dominican College in NY. After a successful career in marketing and graphic design at Sony, she rekindled her passion for art and returned to her painting roots. This reunion brought new direction for her life's work and next chapter. Today is her focus is creating soothing art to enhance the power of healing and relaxation. 

Her fine-art collection of acrylic abstracts, seascapes, and landscapes are inspired by the magnetism of water, the beauty of nature, and the ever-changing skyline. Her style and color spectrums are spontaneous and reflect passion for the freedom of creative response. Lori stated, "I never know which direction the painting will take until it begins to take form and assume personality." Within each work, the intent is to engage emotion, curiosity, and perspective.

Her award-winning works have been exhibited at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, NY; The Greens at Cannondale, Wilton, CT; Greenwich Flinn Gallery; Greenwich Bendheim Gallery; Stamford Art Association; Stamford Ferguson Library; Stamford Loft Artists Gallery, NY; Mattatuck Museum; Darien/Rowayton Bank; Art Society of Old Greenwich; Pequot Library; Carriage Barn Arts Center; Ridgefield Guild of Artists; Darien Arts Center; Saint Aloysius Parish, New Canaan; New Rochelle Art Association; and the NYC Architectural Digest Home Design Show.

As a Connecticut resident, she enjoys the coastal backdrop of New England. Her work is featured in local venues and private collections. [Visit Her Website](http://www.camelotart.com "Visit Her Website")
