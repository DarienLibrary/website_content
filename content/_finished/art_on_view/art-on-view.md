#### About the Artist
Sally Bushing has lived in Darien for thirty-one years, in just about every neighborhood. She does like to change the view outside her windows more than the average person. Sally has been a participating artist in The Fairfield County "Plein Air" group and The Rowayton Art Center. Previously, as a Board Member of The Rowayton Art Center, she hosted their 50th Anniversary at The Tokeneke Club. She has donated paintings to many fundraising events including The Darien Nature Center, The Darien Garden Club, The Darien Historical Society, and Darien Library. Her paintings were displayed at the Darien Toy Box, as a participant in "Art Around Town."

Sally loves living in Darien, and thoroughly enjoys it's beauty. When not at her easel, she can be found biking, golfing, skiing and playing tennis. We hope you enjoy her colorful show.
