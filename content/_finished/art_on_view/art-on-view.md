### About the Artist
The Artistic Director of the DHS musical this spring in Justin Mossa (also the extremely talented brother of the young women who was in the gallery before Jayson). He would like to curate a show of the art of the production - sets, costumes, marketing, front of shhp (lobby) etc. Nothing would be sold; rather it would be a collection of the artistic steps in the design process of a stage production: mood boards, preliminary sketches, construction models to-scale, costume flats, costume pieces on mannequins, etc.
