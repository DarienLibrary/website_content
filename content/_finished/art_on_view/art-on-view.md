#### About the artist
My name is Ella Moore and I recently graduated Darien High School. Throughout my high school career I transitioned from being afraid to make a mark on a piece of paper to doing oil paintings on huge canvases. Through this experience I have learnt a lot about myself as an artist.

I have loved to paint, draw, and design for as long as I can remember. I loved to tell stories with my artwork by capturing a passing moment or utilizing expression to convey an atmosphere. I tried to draw upon this life long fascination the past academic year in my AP Studio Art class. My concentration explored how shadows can manipulate portraiture and the human form and an overall atmosphere within a painting. While I delved into this concentration I began to develop an individual voice and passion for my artwork. I like to bring in expressive mark making and texture to my pieces along with dynamic compositions and provocative subjects in an effort to use my artwork as a platform to connect and empathize with others.

I was honored to receive this year’s Ginny Wright Scholarship and Award. It means so much for me to have my artwork recognized and respected by so many. I’m excited to continue growing in confidence and in my skills as I continue my education at Rhode Island School of Design.
