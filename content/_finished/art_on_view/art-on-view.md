### Current Exhibit: Harvest

**Saturday, August 4th through Saturday, August 25th**
<br />
<br />

Harvest” is a creative arts festival presented by the Darien High School Class of 1973. It will feature the diverse talents of more than twenty individual members of the class, all of whom grew up in Darien, and who were educated in the Darien public school system during the ‘60s and early ‘70s. Many of them have maintained lifelong friendships, something greatly enhanced these days by the existence of social media. Like many high school graduates, they eventually found themselves dispersed about the globe. 

This exhibit coincides with their 45th year high school reunion, as they gather together in Darien during the first weekend of August. Participants currently hail from Hong Kong, Toronto, and numerous locations scattered about the country. Participating Darien residents will be William Frate, Jim Hett, and Lynne Stitzel Tiano.
