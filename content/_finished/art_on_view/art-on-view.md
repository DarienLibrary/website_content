#### About the artist
John Coots has taken painting classes for 20 years at the Silvermine Art School in New Canaan, studying with Alex McFarlane, David Dunlop, Kirill Doron, and Claire Watson Garcia. Coots paints contemporary still life and local landscapes. He is a self-described “precocious hobbyist” who most admires the art of Sir Winston Churchill “because Churchill found time to paint while doing other things.”

Coots publishes two dozen weekly newspapers in small towns scattered around New England. His career in journalism started in college at the Yale Daily News. After business school at University of Virginia, Coots spent twenty years running newspapers for a large publicly-traded corporation until 1994 when he started his own company.

John and his wife Sandy have lived in Darien for 26 years and raised their four boys here.
