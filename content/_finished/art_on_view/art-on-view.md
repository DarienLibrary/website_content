### About the Artist
Bruce Horan is a painter and printmaker and is an alum of Darien High School, University of Connecticut, and Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. Since receiving his MFA in printmaking from Pratt Institute, he has been working on a series of paintings and prints that capture his impressions and experiences of the complex and busy world around us. 

Bruce's paintings blur the distinctions between abstraction and impressionism by incorporating gestural expression and loose figurative representation. His figures and shapes represent a journey through our busy surroundings where we redefine and interpret the people we meet, the streets we walk through, the buildings that encroach upon us, and the objects that we encounter along our path. The colors and energies of our environments combine to create a new visual representation of our world.
