#### About the Artist
After studying illustration and painting for five years at Paier School of Art in New Haven, Connecticut, Steve graduated and went on to exhibit his artwork at various art shows along the East Coast.

In 1969, he married his wife Linda and accepted a position as Art Director with BBDO in New York City. In his free time, he painted and freelanced doing illustrations, cartooning, and finished art.

Art Direction and freelance kept him pretty busy. In 1978, he left the agency and started his own studio in New York City. Twenty years later, he decided to work out of his house in Darien, Connecticut and moved his studio home.

Steve has created art for many years, be it illustrations in mixed media or fine art in oils and has recently started exhibiting his work at art shows in the local area.

He hopes you enjoy them.
