### About the Show
Creativity can be acquired but in Allesandra’s manifestation it is inherited. Observing her father design, both personally and professionally, she continues to be inspired by his innovation. Equipped with a Bachelor of Fine Art, she is technically trained to see differently. Her concentration in printmaking allows for the ability to breakdown what she captures into layers: dissecting colors, textures, and shapes. Her Art History minor influences the desire to explore, locally and remotely, to persist imaginative intrigue. Allesandra’s willingness to be open to cultures, expressions, practices and concepts progresses her craft forward. Her most recent compositions depict discoveries in a commuter’s daily grind. She finds beauty in the mundane, elevating what most may simply pass by…

The act of reflecting influences the act of capturing reflections.

The act of reflecting is defined as a consequence that arises an idea; An obscure reproach and consideration of; pondering over…A thought, idea, and opinion formed as a result of meditation.

A reflection is formally described as an image seen; a throwing back by a surface;

I define both as an encompassing metaphor on the mind’s eye...

My creations are derived from the exploration of the surfaces that surround me, the images that are thrown back in my face. I am inspired from the reflections of these experiences and my imagination grows more intricate as my character deepens through these content rich exchanges. My eyes are enlivened by the interaction and juxtaposition of nature and modernity. My creative power is peaked by the glowing hues, the sharp geometrics, and the organic textures. 

My meditations culminate on the walls before you.
