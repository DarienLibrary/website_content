#### About the Artist
Lynne Byrneâ€™s unique photographic imagery offers a glimpse of the everyday miracles seen in our natural environment. The photographer uses natural light, and close up photography to explore the intricate textures, surfaces, reflections and variations in color that often go unnoticed until we take a longer, closer, more deliberate world around us.
