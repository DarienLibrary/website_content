#### About the Show
I have been quilting since I was 14 years old and took a class at the Rag Doll here in Darien in 1976. Over the years my quilting has moved to a more modern approach as opposed to traditional. I work with bright colors and bold shapes. I was the President of the NYC Metro Modern Quilt Guild for two years, 2013-2015. I have lived in Darien for about 50 years. I work in Town Hall in the building department.
