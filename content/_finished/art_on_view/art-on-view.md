### Pierre and His Art
 
Achieving a sense of self through the process of painting, drawing and the visual arts alike is a task rarely found amongst the faint hearted. When we place emphasis on the process and discipline that are required of the Arts we pay homage to ourselves, the Art and the messages we were meant to convey. Some people associate me with darkness and my answer is, I need to look at the dialogue between light and dark. That explains my choices of topics which deal with the battles between angels and demons, rigidity and softness as well as architecture, portraits, all elements of emotion. I find many abandoned places and objects giving me a precarious sense of belonging where every phase of discoloration identifies the traces of time.
