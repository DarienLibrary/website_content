Social Media and online resources make it easy for anyone to create, manipulate, and share information. With a click of a button, an article or picture can be retweeted, reposted, or reshared resulting in thousands if not millions of people seeing the content. That is how something goes viral and with so much sharing of information, it is important to be able to identify misinformation from truth.
