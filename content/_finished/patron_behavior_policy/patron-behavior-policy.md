<h4><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i> Purpose</h4>

In an effort to provide a comfortable and safe environment for all Library patrons, the Board of Trustees of the Darien Library has established a Library Patron Behavior Policy. The Policy is designed to provide clear and reasonable guidelines governing patron behavior within the Library and on the Library premises.
<br />
<br />
<h4><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i> Unacceptable Behavior</h4>

Unacceptable behavior includes behavior within the Library or on Library premises that interferes with the use of the Library by other patrons, creates a risk of injury to other patrons or Library personnel, interferes with the work of Library personnel, or creates a risk of damage to Library property. Unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to:

1. Use of profanity, abusive or threatening language
2. Threatening gestures or unwanted physical contact
3. Possession of weapons of any kind, except by law enforcement officers
4. Damaging, defacing or theft of any Library property or materials
5. Possession or use of alcohol except at authorized Library functions
6. Possession or use of illegal drugs, narcotics, or controlled substances
7. Use of tobacco or nicotine products, including e-cigarettes, within twenty-five feet of Library doors
8. Viewing pornographic material
9. Leaving children under the age of 8 unattended in the Library (please see Appendix A)
10. Unreasonable noise levels including shouting, loud talking or disruptive conversation, allowing ringing cell phones or engaging in loud cell phone conversation outside designated areas
11. Lack of personal hygiene that interferes with the use and enjoyment of the Library by other patrons or interferes with the work of Library personnel
12. Bringing animals into the Library, except registered service animals or those who are part of a program
13. Leaving unattended animals on Library property

<br />
<h4><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i> Enforcement</h4>

Violation of the Policy may result in escalating responses ranging from limitation or revocation of the patron’s Library privilege(s) to removal from the premises or criminal prosecution if the conduct constitutes a violation of local, state or federal law. Library staff may ask to examine users' handbags, briefcases, or other packages to help assure compliance with check out procedures; the Library reserves the right to confiscate unattended backpacks, duffle bags, etc.

The Director or his authorized designee, upon staff recommendation, may limit or revoke the patron’s Library privileges. Such limitation or revocation shall be in writing and shall be effective upon being sent to the patron’s address on file with the Library. A patron whose privileges have been limited or revoked may appeal the limitation or revocation of the privileges by filing a written appeal with the Director within ten (10) days from the date of the issuance of the written revocation. The appeal will be forwarded to the Board of Trustees, whose decision is final. The patron whose privileges has been limited or revoked must attend a meeting with the Director to review this Library Patron Behavior Policy before his or her privileges may be reinstated.
