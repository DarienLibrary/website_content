### Changes to the Museum Passes Program Due to COVID-19
Several of the museums that Darien Library usually offers passes for have not reopened or are not accepting library passes at this time. [Browse passes](https://dar.to/3EkHtGi "Browse passes") from the museums, nature centers, and Bradley Zoo that are currently open. You can also [join our new exhibits mailing list](https://dar.to/2HWImat "Join mailing list"). We quarterly send out an email listing our favorite current and upcoming exhibits. 

* These passes are on a first-come, first-served basis to Darien residents, those who work in Darien, or a Friend at the $300 level who are age 18 and up.
* Reserve a pass for the date before you will visit the destination and then pick it up at the Welcome Desk on the day of your reservation. 
* Passes circulate for three days including the date the pass is borrowed. 
* Your confirmation notice will include the due date and the pass is due back by 5 p.m. on the due date.
* Return the pass to the Welcome Desk. Late fines are $10 per day. If a pass is lost, you will need to pay the full replacement cost. 
* Only one pass per family is allowed at a time. 
* You may not borrow the same pass more than once a week.
