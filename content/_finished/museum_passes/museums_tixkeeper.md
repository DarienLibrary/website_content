### Changes to the Museum Passes Program Due to COVID-19
Several of the museums that Darien Library usually offers passes for have not reopened or are not accepting library passes at this time. [Browse passes](https://dar.to/3EkHtGi "Browse passes") from the museums, nature centers, and Bradley Zoo that are currently open. You can also [join our new exhibits mailing list](https://dar.to/2HWImat "Join mailing list"). We quarterly send out an email listing our favorite current and upcoming exhibits. 

We have also updated our museum passes program:  

* Museum passes are available on a first-come, first-served basis to Darien residents, those who work in Darien, or a Friend at the $300 level.  
* Pass borrows must be 18 and up who have a Darien Library card. 
* The passes are available at the Welcome Desk when you first enter the building. 
* You may call us at [203-669-5239](tel:2036695239 "Call the Welcome Desk") to inquire if a pass is available. If yes, we will hold it for you until the end of the day. 
* Online reservations are not available. 
* It is your responsibility to check the museum's hours and when necessary, make an appointment.
