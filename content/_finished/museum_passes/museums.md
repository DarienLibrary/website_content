### Featured Museum

The [New York Historical Society](http://www.nyhistory.org/exhibitions/picassos-le-tricorne "New York Historical Society") has a newly acquired and conserved Picasso in the exhibition Picasso's "Le Tricorne." It is the first work by Picasso to enter New-York Historical's collection. Pablo Picasso painted the stage curtain for the two-act ballet The Three-Cornered Hat (El sombrero de tres picos or Le tricorne). The ballet and curtain were commissioned by the impresario Sergei Diaghilev for his avant-garde, Paris-based Ballets Russes. The ballet was choreographed by LÃ©onide Massine with music by the Spanish composer Manuel de Falla. It premiered on July 22, 1919, at the Alhambra Theatre in London with sets, costume designs, and the monumental stage curtain created by Picasso.
