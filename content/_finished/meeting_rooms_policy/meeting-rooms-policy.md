<h4><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i> Statement of Policy</h4>

The Darien Library subscribes to Article IV of the Library Bill of Rights which states that facilities should be made available to the public served by the Library on an equitable basis, regardless of the beliefs or affiliations of individuals or groups requesting their use. 

The Darien Library considers the availability and use of its Meeting Rooms as an integral part of its service to the community. In that regard, Meeting Rooms are available, when not required for Library activities, to qualifying Darien non-profit organizations, to Town of Darien Boards, Departments and Commissions, State of CT and United States governmental organizations, and to for-profit organizations for their own internal purposes only. 

<br />

<h4><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i> Application Procedure</h4>

The Room Bookings Coordinator will review the online application form submitted by any qualified applicant, and will process applications in order of their receipt. The application is available online on the Library’s web site.

To that extent there should be no images or likenesses of the Library, no use of the Library’s logo, or a combination of colors and typeface that mirror the Library’s. Non-library groups and individuals may not use the Library’s address and phone number as their own or as contact information regarding their event.
