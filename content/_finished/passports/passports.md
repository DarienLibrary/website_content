Get your passport at Darien Library! We will process and accept new and renewal applications on Tuesday and Thursday evenings. Once a month, we have a Passport Day on a Saturday. Please check the [event listings](/events/?category=special-event "Event listings") to see when we will offer a Saturday Passport Day. 

We will provide all the paperwork. Passport photos can be taken in Darien at CVS or Big Shots. Passport photos are regulated by the law, so they need to fit [legal requirements](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/passports/photos/photos.html "Information about Passport Photos").

### Passports for Minors
Minors under age 16 cannot apply for a passport by themselves. Both parents/guardians must appear in person and provide consent, authorizing passport issuance to the minor. If one parent/guardian is unable to appear in person, then the application must be accompanied by a signed, notarized [Form DS-3053](http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/212243.pdf "Form DS-3053"): Statement of Consent from the non-applying parent/guardian.
