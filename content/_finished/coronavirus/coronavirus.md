### Darien Library Closed
We are closed until further notice due to the coronavirus outbreak.
<br />
<br />

### All Programs Cancelled
Governor Lamont called for large events to be cancelled to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus in Connecticut. After consulting with First Selectman Jayme Stevenson, the Darien Health Department, and our Board, we have decided to cancel all programs effective immediately. This includes postponing the Novel Tea fundraiser. We will share updates for those attendees in the near future. 

Tax Preparation and Assistance will continue as it is a service when the Library reopens. [See upcoming dates](https://dar.to/2RoWmhV "See upcoming dates") on Mondays, Fridays, and Saturdays.
<br />
<br />

### Action Plan
Any patrons who are experiencing symptoms of the virus (fever, cough, shortness of breath) are encouraged to seek medical attention immediately. When we reopen, to protect other patrons and staff, visitors who exhibit these symptoms will be asked to leave the Library and return when fully recovered.

The entire Library is cleaned thoroughly every day, and our cleaners will also take extra care while wiping down door handles, elevator buttons, push bars, and other public surfaces.
