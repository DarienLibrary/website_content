## Why are books taking longer to arrive?
You may have noticed books you’ve requested taking longer to arrive at the Library. There are two issues causing delays at libraries, bookstores, and book distributors right now:

* A global supply shortage causing delays in bringing books to market
* A global and national labor shortage causing delays at our book distributor

Darien Library is not the only organization affected by these shortages – this is a widespread problem affecting the distribution chain for all goods across the world.
