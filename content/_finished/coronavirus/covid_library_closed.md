This week, we became aware of four cases of COVID-19 among our staff. Subsequent contact tracing identified six additional staff members who were in close contact with the infected parties. All 10 Darien Library staff members are currently under quarantine per local Department of Health and CDC guidelines. 

We made the decision to close the Library building on Thursday, March 4th and Friday, March 5th to complete contact tracing and fully sanitize all public and staff spaces. 

Regrettably, due to staffing constraints resulting from the number of librarians currently under quarantine, we are unable to open the building to the public until Thursday, March 11th. 

In the meantime, remote services, virtual programming, and digital collections are available. While the building is closed, returns will be available beginning Saturday, March 6th, and Community Room pickup will be available beginning Sunday, March 7th.

Please see below for our full list of when and what library services will be available over the next few days. 

For any questions, please contact me at [kparrott@darienlibrary.org](kparrott@darienlibrary.org "Email Kiera") or [(203) 669-5224](tel:2036695224). 


We look forward to welcoming you back into the building soon,
