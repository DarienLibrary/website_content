### In-Library 
The Magazine Reading Room, located on the Second Level, is home to over 275 individual magazines and newspapers. This is a quiet reading area, a lovely spot to browse and read in peace. Comfortable chairs and couches surround a fireplace that is always lit during the cooler months.

Current magazine issues are for in-Library use only, however there is no limit on the number of older issues you may borrow.

Daily issues of the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> and <em>The New York Times</em> are located at the Reference Desk.
