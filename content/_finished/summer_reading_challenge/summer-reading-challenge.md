Are you up for a summer of great reading? As a community, we are challenging everyone to collectively read 10,000 books by Friday, September 2nd. 
<br />
<br />

### Here’s the Scoop
After reading your first book, stop by the Welcome Desk for a “Community Challenge” wristband and a sticker to add to our reading column.

Continue to add stickers to the reading columns for every book you read throughout the summer. If you can’t visit us at the library, please email us to let us know what you have read and we will add the sticker for you.

Every week, we will tally the number of books read to watch our numbers grow.

No registration and open to all book lovers! Help Darien Library reach this significant goal.
