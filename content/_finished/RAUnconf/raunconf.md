In 2016, we hosted a Readers' Advisory Unconference (aka #RAUNCON) which brought 100 librarians from several states together to share their RA knowledge with each other. With a keynote by RA expert Barry Trott and a lunchtime visit with author Helen Ellis, it was an amazing day. On this page, you'll find notes from unconference sessions, tweets from the day, photos, and other resources. [Email organizer Stephanie](sanderson@darienlibrary.org "Email Stephanie") to add more!
