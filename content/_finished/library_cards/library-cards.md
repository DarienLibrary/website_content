Do you want to join Darien Library? That's great! We're glad to have you here. To check out materials or use a computer, you need to have a library card. It's a quick and easy process. Just come to the Welcome Desk when you first enter the Library to get started. 

<br />

### To get a Darien Libary card
Bring in to the Welcome Desk something with your Darien address on it (e.g. a piece of mail, your license, lease/mortgage agreement, etc.). If you work in Town full-time, bring your pay stub or your employer's phone number so we can verify it. Friends at the $300 level automatically get a Non-Resident membership card.

<br />

### I Live in Another Town in Connecticut
You can still check out stuff from Darien Library. Just bring in your library card from your hometown library. We will add you to our system. There are some limitations to your membership: you cannot place holds on DVDs, attend classes or workshops, or access digital content. If you want full access, become a [Friend of the Library](/friends "Friend of the Library"). For more information, visit [Borrowing](/page/borrowing "Borrowing")
