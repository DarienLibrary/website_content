<div class="col-md-8">

## Hello, fellow travelers!
This summer you will complete reading and activity challenges as you make your way across the Summer Reading maps from Darien, Connecticut all the way to San Francisco, California! There are two different paths to crossing the country: a game for children from birth to kindergarten and another for children in kindergarten through sixth grade. 

The fuel for your roadtrip is to complete reading challenges. You can read any way you want from checking out physical books, downloading e-Books, or listening to audiobooks. Everyone who registers will receive a free book that they can pick up at the Children's Library.

<br />
<br />

### Prizes
For both age groups, every challenge completed equals one raffle ticket to enter into one of our many prize baskets. If your child completes all the challenges on the map by August 14th, they will be entered into the Grand Prize drawing! Each bonus challenge completed equals one extra raffle ticket for the prize baskets.

### Birth to Kindergarten
Pre-readers can complete the challenges on their own Summer Reading road map in any order between June 21st and August 14th. These challenges will help pre-readers practice the five early literacy skills: reading, writing, singing, playing, and talking. 

Children can participate in Summer Reading through **[Beanstack](https://dar.to/2Vbxijj "Beanstack")** or complete their challenges on our paper map. Paper maps must be turned in by August 14th to be eligible for the Summer Reading prizes.

### How to Play
Pre-readers will earn one ticket for each challenge that they complete that they can enter into one of our Prize Basket drawings. Participants must select which of the prizes they would like to win when they complete each badge on Beanstack. 

If a participant is using their paper map, they will fill out a prize form when they turn in their road map at the end of the summer. Participants must select which prize baskets they would like to submit their tickets on Beanstack as this is not done automatically.
