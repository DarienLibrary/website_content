</div>  

Summer is here! With the sunshine and warm weather, life can feel a little less hectic. As we slow down, it's a perfect time to escape into an enjoyable story. We invite all of our adult patrons to join us for again for Adult Summer Reading. This year, we will have a time-themed reading challenge, fun prizes, and special events throughout the summer. Patrons can play online or pick up their game cards at the Library’s Welcome Desk starting July 1st. Patrons can play as often as they would like.

Darien Library is proud to support local businesses. The **grand prize** is a $100 gift certificate to [Barrett Bookstore](https://dar.to/2TUKaIw "Barrett Bookstore"). We will also be awarding three $25 Barrett Bookstore gift certificates throughout the summer.
