Summer reading is the ultimate escape, and we want to invite all of our adult patrons to “Reach For The Stars." This year, we will have a celestial-themed reading challenge, fun prizes, and special events throughout the summer. Patrons can pick up their game maps at the Library’s Welcome Desk starting June 3rd. Registration is not required and patrons can play as many times as they want. 

The **grand prize** is a one-year family membership to the [American Museum of Natural History](https://dar.to/2HMIBI9 "American Museum of Natural History") in New York City.
