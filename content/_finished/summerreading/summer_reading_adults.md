### Welcome to Adult Summer Reading

Join us for programs, a game, and an opportunity to win prizes throughout the summer. To win prizes, you will need to fill out a bingo card which can be downloaded and printed off the Library's website or picked up at the front desk. Then return to the front desk when you've hit bingo!
