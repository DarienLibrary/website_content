We provide high-quality educational and entertainment programming. When permissible, we film visits from authors, lectures, and workshops to post to [DarienLibrary.TV](http://darienlibrary.tv/ "DarienLibrary.TV"). Just because you have to miss an event in person doesn't mean you can't join in online later.
