Welcome to Darien Library's Bookfix! We know you love to get a hand-selected book from our readers' advisors, and this new service makes it easier than ever.

Just fill out this form and and every six weeks, we will put a personalized book selection on the hold shelf for you. We'll email when your book is ready and follow up to see what you think. It's that easy! 

This form is intended for readers of adult books. If you are interested in reading teen or children's books, or in an annotated list of recommendations rather than a book on hold, please check out our [_You Are What You Read Next_](/yawyr-next "You Are What You Read Next") service.
