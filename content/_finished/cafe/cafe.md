Don't work hungry at the Library. The Frosty Bear Café, conveniently located on the First Floor next to the Community Room, is a great place to pick up a snack or even a meal. We offer a variety of breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack choices. You won't have to interrupt your work to go grab a meal. Food and drinks are allowed throughout the Library.

Enjoy the Soup of the Day and beef or turkey chili. Sandwiches, wraps, veggie balls and veggie burgers are made on-site. New options appear on a regular basis, so check back often. 

We also cater any meetings or special event that you are having at the Library. Just call John, the owner/operator of the Café, at [203-669-5250](tel:203-669-5250 "203-669-5250") to plan for your next event.
