### Safe, Important, and Easy
The constitutionally required 2020 Census seeks a complete count of everyone who lives within the United States. The results will determine how trillions of federal dollars will be distributed over the next ten years and how congressional districts are drawn.

> "Your answers can only be used to produce statistics—they cannot be used against you in any way," [per the U.S. Census Bureau](https://dar.to/2QZRy5n "https://dar.to/2QZRy5n"). 

Please remember to include babies as they'll help the local school districts plan for future attendance numbers.

### For College Students
Since most **college students** have moved home now, they still need to be counted where they should have been on April 1st (i.e. at their college) per the [Census Bureau](https://dar.to/2Jg2LdO "Census Bureau"). The below information is from that link: 
* College students living in on-campus housing are counted through their university as part of our Group Quarters Operation, which counts all students living in university owned housing.
* In general, students in colleges and universities temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 virus will still be counted as part of this process. Even if they are home on census day, April 1st, they should be counted according to the residence criteria which states they should be counted **where they live and sleep most of the time**. We are asking schools to contact their students and remind them to respond.
* Per the Census Bureau’s residence criteria, in most cases students living away from home at school should be counted at school, even if they are temporarily elsewhere due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
