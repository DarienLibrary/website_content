### From the Director
On May 29, 2019, we celebrated Darien Library’s 125th year. That day was a capstone to another remarkable year in the life of a Library that has seen many remarkable years. Some of the year was spent looking back over our history and growth, and you’ll see much of that set forth in this _Annual Report_.

When you look, I hope you will see the past through the same lens I do.

I see that since its founding in 1894, Darien Library has represented many things to many people. But the constant from that year through the construction of the first library in 1957, two expansions of that building, and then the opening of the wonderful new building in 2009 has been the enduring and defining role the Friends of Darien Library have played in making Darien Library the heart and soul of the community.

The leadership role of the Friends is as important today as ever. We have 125 years of history and tradition, but each new day is a day when we look to build a future of even greater service to our community for generations to come. All with funding from the Friends. None if there were no Friends.

What _will_ we do tomorrow? What _can_ we do in all the tomorrows to come? What new resources, services, information, comfortable spaces, books, eBooks, DVDs, streaming video, electronic resources, technology, and programs will there be?

I do not know, but I do know that whatever the future brings, it will be because of your support.

We look forward to that future with excitement and confidence.

Thank you. 

Alan Kirk Gray<br />
