Check Out Items

</h4>

<div class="panel-body">

**Can I get a library card?** <br />
 Sure, it's easy! If you live in Darien, simply bring in something with your Darien address on it (e.g. a piece of mail, your license, a tax bill, or your lease/mortgage agreement). If you work in Darien full-time, bring your pay stub or a letter from your employer verifying your full-time employment. [Friends](/friends "Friends of the Library") at the $300 level or above are eligible for a Non-Resident Member card.

**I don't live in Darien. Can I check out books here?** <br />
Absolutely! Just bring your hometown library card and we will register you in our system. Please note that eBooks and other digital content is only available to Darien residents and [Friends of the Library](/friends "Friend of the Library")Friends of the Library.

**Where do I pick up my holds?** <br />
When holds are ready to be picked up we put them in a special area behind the Welcome Desk on the first floor. You can walk in and pick up your books without any staff assistance. Please note that books on hold still need to be checked out!

**Do I have to check out items placed on hold for me?** <br />
Yes, please check your items at the self checkouts. 

**Can I renew this item?** <br />
Generally yes. Items which have other people waiting on them may not be renewed. You can put another request on it to finish it later. 14-day books (described below) are not renewable. 

**What are 14-day books?** <br />
14-day books are the hottest items in our collection straight from the top of the bestseller lists! If you think you can read the book in two weeks or less, this is the collection for you!

You'll find 14-days on our Main Level straight across from where you enter the Library from the parking lot.

**How do I return items?** <br />
Pull into the Library's driveway from Post Road. The 24/7 book drop is located between the Library and the parking lot as you drive around the building. If you drive past the fountain, you've missed it. 

If you are coming into the building from the parking lot side, the book returns are in the entry way. 

**Where are the large type books?** <br />
On the Main Level, make a left at the Welcome Desk and walk through the stacks all the way to the fireplace. The large type books surround this comfortable reading space.

Fines
</a>
</h4>
</div>
<div class="panel-collapse collapse" id="collapse-Four">
<div class="panel-body">

**Why do I have a fine on my account?** <br />
Oh no! We're sorry to hear that. Fines are caused by three things: 
* Item not returned on time
* Item is lost or returned missing a part (like a CD)
* Item is damaged (this is a replacement fee)

The Library attempts to keep you aware of when your items are due by: 
* Offering a checkout slip which lists the due date
* Sending you email reminders
* Listing your checked out items on your website account

If you need a receipt of what you checked out, please see the Welcome Desk.

**Where do I pay my fine?** <br />
Please pay at the Welcome Desk or [online](https://payments.darienlibrary.org/eCommerceWebModule/Home "Pay your fine online").

**What does a fine stop me from doing?** <br />
Once you owe $50, you will be unable to checkout items or use a computer. Please get the amount under $50 to resume using the Library's services.

**Why don't seniors have fines?** <br />
To acknowledge the many years of contribution and service that our senior patrons have made to the Library, we waive overdue fees on items for patrons 65 years and older. Those who still want to pay overdue fees are welcome to make a contribution!

The Library is a busy place with people using the space in different ways. If you want a quiet place to work, our recommendations: 

* **Quiet Study Rooms:** Ask the Reference Librarian on the Second Level to schedule you. This is a no-talking space for up to two people.
* **First Floor Fireplace:** In the winter months, relax and enjoy a soothing fire. Find the fireplace behind the fiction shelves to the left when you enter the building from the parking lot. 
* **Magazine, Art, Business Sections, and Classics Room:** On the Second Level, head towards the far left side of the building (towards Darien, not the cemetery). Enjoy a whole area devoted to quiet time.

</h4>

<div class="panel-collapse collapse" id="collapse-v4-Five">
<div class="panel-body">

**What are 3D printers?**<br />
3D Printers allow you to print a digital file into a physical object. You can download designs online or create your own. [Learn more about 3D printing](/page/3d-printers "3D Printing") at Darien Library.

**Can I use the 3D Printer?**<br />
Yes! You may use the printers directly or submit a print order. Read about your [3D printing options](/page/3d-printers "3D Printing").

**Does it cost anything to print a 3D object?**<br />
If you are a child twelve and under, you may print your object for free in the TEA Room. If you are older, you may use one of the other printers for a [low fee](/page/3d-printers "3D printers"). 

**Can I make a 3D print from a photo?**<br />
We wish! The technology isn't there yet. 

**I have this item that I want a copy of it. Can I 3D print a new one?**<br />
If you bring in something from your house (e.g. a cabinet handle, a toy, etc.) and wish to make a duplicate of it, library staff cannot design the digital file. You may learn how to do that via watching an online course from [Lynda.com](/search?search=lynda.com&filter=ResearchResource "Lynda.com").

**Can I scan this item and make a copy that way?**<br />
The quality of 3D scanners at this time are not as easy as scanning and making a perfect copy. You may try to use the 3D scanner located in the [Digital Media Lab](/dml "Digital Media Lab"), but you will need to have the skillset to edit the scan file to improve it. Most scanned objects come out lumpy and are not suitable for printing.
