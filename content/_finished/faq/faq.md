#### What do I need to log into the website?
You need your library card number and the email address you gave the Library when you registered. If you have forgotten which email address you gave or library card number, please call us at [203-669-5238](tel:2036695238 "203-669-5238").
<br />
<br />

#### What is my password?
The Library's website does not have a password. Instead, it relies on your library card number and the email address you gave the Welcome Desk when you registered your card. If you have forgotten which email address you gave, please call us at [203-669-5238](tel:2036695238 "203-669-5238").
<br />
<br />

#### Why can't I login with my username and password from the previous site?
For your convenience, we've changed how you log into your library website account. You will need your library card number and the email address you gave the Library when you registered. The advantage of this new login system is that you can now manage your family member's library accounts through linked account feature — a very popular request!
<br />
<br />

### How do I change my website account settings? 
Go to [Settings](/myaccount/settings "Settings").
<br />
<br />

### How do I change my email address?
Go to [Update Your Account Information](/myaccount/settings/profile/edit "Update Your Account Information") and enter your new email address.

Linked Accounts
</a>
</h4>
</div>
<div class="panel-collapse collapse" id="collapse-Two">
<div class="panel-body">

#### Can I manage my child or family member's library account?
Yes, simply go to [My Account](/myaccount/settings/addlink "My Account") and enter your family member's library card number and the email address they have on record with the Library. Then click on Link Account to finalize the connection. 
<br />
<br />

#### What are linked accounts?
With a [linked account](/myaccount/settings "Linked account"), you can manage other people's library accounts. You can see their checkouts, holds, fines & fees, wishlist items, and checkout history. The person whose account you're linked to cannot see your information in return. 

For example, Lucy has linked to her daughter's account. Lucy can see her daughter's checkout history, what she wants to read next (wishlist), and that she has no overdue fees. Her daughter cannot Lucy's account information. 
<br />
<br />

#### What do you mean by managed?
If you have linked access to someone else's account, you can see their checkouts, items on hold, wishlist, checkout history, and fines. You can then make changes like add money to their library account or remove a book from their checkout history.
<br />
<br />

#### How can I keep someone from linking to My Account? 
By default, linking account is enabled. To turn it off, go to your [Settings](/myaccount/settings "Settings") and click the button next to **Account Linking**. 

* If it says ON, people can link to your account. 
* If it says OFF, no one can link to your account.
<br />

#### Whose accounts am I linked to? 
Go to your [Settings](/myaccount/settings "Settings") and click on **Linked Accounts**. You can see whose accounts you've linked to so you can see their account. As well, you can see accounts linking to you. 
<br />
<br />

#### I have linked to someone else's account. Can they see my information?
No. If you entered their barcode and email address into your [Add a linked account](/myaccount/settings/addlink "Add a linked account") page, you can see their information, but they cannot see yours.
<br />
<br />

#### Someone has linked to My Account. How can I unlink it?
Go to your [Settings](/myaccount/settings "Settings") and click on **Unlink Account** to break the connection.

Check Out Items
</a>
</h4>
</div>
<div class="panel-collapse collapse" id="collapse-Three">
<div class="panel-body">

#### Can I get a library card?
 Sure, it's easy! If you live in Darien, simply bring in something with your Darien address on it (e.g. a piece of mail, your license, a tax bill, or your lease/mortgage agreement). If you work in Darien full-time, bring your pay stub or a letter from your employer verifying your full-time employment. [Friends](/friends "Friends of the Library") at the $300 level or above are eligible for a Non-Resident Member card.
<br />
<br />

#### I don't live in Darien. Can I check out books here?
Absolutely! Just bring your hometown library card and we will register you in our system. Please note that e-Books and other digital content is only available to Darien residents and [Friends of the Library](/friends "Friend of the Library").
<br />
<br />

#### What do I have checked out?
View your [Checkouts & Holds](/myaccount/circulation "Checkouts & Holds") list. Notice that you can see

* Items Borrowed
* Items on Hold
* Digital Downloads
* Digital Holds
<br />

#### What are holds?
Holds refers to when you "place hold" on an item so it will be taken off the shelf and waiting for you when you come to the Library. However, if the availability of the item says 0 of XX (some number), that means there is no copy right now. So you will be notified via email when your item is ready for pick up. 
<br />
<br />

#### Where do I pick up my holds?
When holds are ready to be picked up we put them in a special area behind the Welcome Desk on the first floor. You can walk in and pick up your books without any staff assistance. Please note that books on hold still need to be checked out!
<br />
<br />

#### Do I have to check out items placed on hold for me?
Yes, please check your items at the self check outs. 
<br />
<br />

#### When are my items due?
View your [Checkouts & Holds](/myaccount/circulation "Checkouts & Holds") list to see when your items are due. 
<br />
<br />

#### Can I renew this item?
Generally yes. Items which have other people waiting on them may not be renewed. You can put another request on it to finish it later. 14-day books (described below) are not renewable. 

View your [Checkouts & Holds](/myaccount/circulation "Checkouts & Holds") list to see if you can renew the item. 
<br />
<br />

#### How can I renew my checkouts?

To renew all items, click on **Renew All**. 
<br />
<br />

#### Where is the book or movie in the Library?

<br />
<br />

#### Where are the large type books?
On the Main Level, make a left at the Welcome Desk and walk through the stacks all the way to the fireplace. The large type books surround this comfortable reading space.
<br />
<br />

#### Where do I pick up equipment, gadgets, and museum passes?

* Children and Tween items may be picked up in the Children's Library.
* Museum passes are at the Welcome Desk.
<!-- * All other technology items may be obtained at the Help Desk on the Lower Level. -->
<br />

#### What are 14-day books?
14-day books are the hottest items in our collection straight from the top of the bestseller lists! If you think you can read the book in two weeks or less, this is the collection for you!

You'll find 14-days on our Main Level straight across from where you enter the Library from the parking lot.
<br />
<br />

#### How do I return items?
Pull into the Library's driveway from Post Road. The 24/7 book drop is located between the Library and the parking lot as you drive around the building. If you drive past the fountain, you've missed it. 

If you are coming into the building from the parking lot side, the book returns are in the entry way.

Review Fines
</a>
</h4>
</div>
<div class="panel-collapse collapse" id="collapse-Five">
<div class="panel-body">

#### Why do I have a fine on My Account?
Oh no! We're sorry to hear that. Fines are caused by three things: 
* Item not returned on time
* Item is lost or returned missing a part (like a CD)
* Item is damaged (this is a replacement fee)

The Library attempts to keep you aware of when your items are due by: 
* Offering a checkout slip which lists the due date
* Sending you email reminders
* Listing your checked out items on your website account

If you need a receipt of what you checked out, please see the Welcome Desk.
<br />
<br />

#### Where do I pay my fine?
Please pay at the Welcome Desk or [online](https://payments.darienlibrary.org/eCommerceWebModule/Home "Pay your fine online").
<br />
<br />

#### What does a fine stop me from doing?
Once you owe $50, you will be unable to check out items or use a computer. Please get the amount under $50 to resume using the Library's services.
<br />
<br />

#### Why don't seniors have fines?
To acknowledge the many years of contribution and service that our senior patrons have made to the Library, we waive overdue fees on items for patrons 65 years and older. Those who still want to pay overdue fees are welcome to make a contribution!

The Library is a busy place with people using the space in different ways. If you want a quiet place to work, our recommendations: 
<br />
<br />

#### Quiet Study Rooms
Ask the Reference Librarian on the Second Level to schedule you. This is a no-talking space for up to two people.
<br />
<br />

#### First Floor Fireplace
In the winter months, relax and enjoy a soothing fire. Find the fireplace behind the fiction shelves to the left when you enter the building from the parking lot. 
<br />
<br />

#### Magazine, Art, Business Sections, and Classics Room
On the Second Level, head towards the far left side of the building (towards Darien, not the cemetery). Enjoy a whole area devoted to quiet time.
