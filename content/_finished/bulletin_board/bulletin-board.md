Darien Library’s Senior Advisory Board presents a Community Bulletin Board for local events and notices. The Board can be found to the left of the Front Desk – just past the desk.
<br/>
<br/>

### Community Bulletin Board Guidelines

- Notices should be approved by a staff member at the Welcome Desk before posting. If something is put up without permission, it may be removed by a Library staff member.
- All notices should be size 8 ½ X 11” or smaller.
- Notices may be posted for library events, tax-supported agencies, non-profit, civic, community groups, or entities with which the Library carries our cooperative programs.
- Library staff will determine the frequency with which materials may be posted for the same group.
- All materials will be initialed and dated by a Library staff member upon approval.
- The Library cannot save notices to be returned to an organization.
- If a notice does not include an end date (for example, a hotline number), it will be removed after two months in order to keep information up-to-date.
- Preference will be given to Darien-centric events.
- The Library reserves the right to make final decisions about notices posted on the Community Bulletin Board.
<br/>

#### The following types of notices may not be posted:
 - Personals ads and notices
- Notices of merchandise or services for sale
- Rental announcements
- Profit-making establishment notices
- Fundraising announcements
