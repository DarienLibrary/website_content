Throughout the history of our country, libraries have served as clearing houses for information and places to convene and exchange ideas. At Darien Library, our mission is to “provide education, entertainment, enrichment, and community building through compassionate service to all.” We take that mission very seriously. Each of us is called to do our part in solving the destructive and long standing problems of racism and inequality, and Darien Library stands with all those who are advocating for racial and social justice and mourning the loss of George Floyd.

Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said, “Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.” As we work collectively for change at this time, Darien Library will be part of the solution by providing resources and promoting opportunities for learning, listening, and engaging with one another. Although the doors of Darien Library are currently closed, you can find antiracism resources at <a href="/antiracism" style="text-decoration:none;">darienlibrary.org/antiracism</a>.

We look forward to sharing new ways to connect with each other on these important topics in the days and weeks to come.


With hope,
