Something has seemed a bit off at Darien University. Tensions are running high and colleagues are being more secretive than normal. During a faculty meeting, you glance at Dr. Francium's notes and discover that he has plans to unleash a deadly airborne virus. The antidote is locked in a safe in his laboratory and you and your colleagues have just an hour to retrieve it- before Dr. Francium returns from his lecture. Use your wits, work together, and find the antidote- our lives depend on it.

Solve puzzles, find clues, and collaborate as a team in Darien Library's first ever [Escape Room](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/04/arts/video-games/in-escape-rooms-video-games-meet-real-life.html "Escape Room"). Escape the Laboratory is meant for adults. Participants are asked to only register for one session. Please arrive at 6:45 p.m. as we will be unable to allow latecomers.
