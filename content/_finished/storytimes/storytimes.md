### How to Register
Parents/caregivers may register online during the specified registration period. Each child can participate in one registered program per session. **Registration is a lottery.** Register your infants and 1-year-olds based on their ability to walk. Register children ages 2 and up based on their age. Registered storytimes are for children whose parents are Darien residents, employed full-time in Darien, or [Friends of Darien Library](/friends "Friends of Darien Library") who contribute annually at the $300 level. Parents will need a Library card to register.

**Please only register for one class per session.**

### Early Literacy Texts
Sign up for our weekly early literacy texts to get easy tips sent right to your phone! It’s totally free (though standard messaging rates apply), and is a service of Darien Library. Your librarians will send a text every Monday with something simple you can integrate into your daily life that will help prepare your child (under 5-years-old) for reading and writing. Text messages will begin on the first day of Registered storytimes. [Sign up for text messages](/early-literacy-texts "Sign up for text messages")
