### Submit a Play
Playwrights are invited to submit their final scripts for consideration to the Catherine Lindsey Actors/Playwrights contest by April 7th. The musicals, monologues, short scenes from full-length and one-act plays to be performed will be chosen by the Darien Library Selection Committee. When writing your piece please keep in mind that the number of cast members is limited, only one play may be submitted per person, and plays must be 10-minutes long or less. Please limit your plays to 10-pages double-spaced, 12 point font.

### Play Dates
Four plays will be selected to be workshopped on Monday, May 1st and Tuesday, May 2nd at 6:30 p.m. Interested actors are invited to audition on Thursday, May 4th at 6:30 p.m. On Sunday, May 21st at 2 p.m., the Actors/Playwrights Workshop will present the first public-staged reading of selections from the plays in the Library's Community Room.

### All Actors Welcome
The Actors/Playwrights Workshop welcomes Actors' Equity actors and non-Equity actors to participate, brings together local and regional playwrights and actors, and encourages a collaborative effort to create new plays and present a public-staged reading. 

The Actors/Playwrights Workshop welcomes all interested playwrights and actors, with or without experience, to join. The sessions offer actors and playwrights the opportunity to work together to create original theatrical works in a supportive and creative
environment, culminating in the May 21st program, which will feature four staged performances.
