### All Actors Welcome
The Actors/Playwrights Workshop welcomes Actors' Equity actors and non-Equity actors to participate, brings together local and regional playwrights and actors, and encourages a collaborative effort to create new plays and present a public-staged reading. 

The Actors/Playwrights Workshop welcomes all interested playwrights and actors, with or without experience, to join. The sessions offer actors and playwrights the opportunity to work together to create original theatrical works in a supportive and creative
environment, culminating in the June 10th program, which will feature four staged performances.
