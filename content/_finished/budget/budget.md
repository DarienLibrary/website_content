Each year, Darien Library submits a budget proposal for the following fiscal year. The budget is reviewed by four different committees before being accepted or amended.
<br />
<br />

### Budget Summary
The Libraryâ€™s budget proposal for fiscal year 2017-2018 calls for expenditures of $3,685,375, an increase of $101,919, or 2.8%.

Nearly all of the proposed increase relates to compensation and benefits for staff.

The budget makes provision for a 5% increase in staff salaries and hourly rates. We are in year 2 of a 3-year plan gradually to increase salaries because our compensation has become uncompetitive with local libraries and national peers.

We also will be reorganizing staff by adding a new full-time position in the understaffed Knowledge and Learning Department, offset by a .69 FTE
decrease in other staffing. The net increase in staffing is 0.31 FTE.

Health Insurance costs are budgeted to decrease by $5,728, as we will be switching health insurance coverage to the State of CT Partnership 2.0 Plan.

Library operating accounts increase by $4,656, as the result of an increase in electricity supply and delivery rates.

These, and other actions, are detailed later in this report.
