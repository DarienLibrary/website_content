Each year, Darien Library submits a budget proposal for the following fiscal year. The budget is reviewed by four different committees before being accepted or amended.
<br />
<br />

### Budget Summary
The Libraryâ€™s budget proposal for fiscal year 2016-2017 calls for expenditures of $3,583,457, an increase of $77,238, or 2.2%.

All of the proposed increase relates to compensation of staff and a reorganization of staffing that results in an increase of 0.47 FTE.

The budget makes provision for a 5% increase in staff salaries and hourly rates as the first of a three-year process to bring Library compensation to competitive levels. We also will be reorganizing staff by adding a new full-time position, offset by a .53 FTE part-time decrease.

Health Insurance costs are budgeted to increase by $6,744, as a slight decline in insurance costs is offset by the addition of one covered staff member. Library and Building operating accounts decrease by $19,850, accounted for primarily by a $29,944 decrease in Maintenance and Service costs.

In accordance with guidance from the Town, we have budgeted a 20.9% decrease in Retirement.

These, and other actions, are detailed later in this report.
