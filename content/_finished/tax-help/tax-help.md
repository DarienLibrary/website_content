## Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) is In-Person and Virtual
<br />
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6">

The VITA Tax-Aide program at Darien Library returns this year with a few changes to ensure the safety of all. You may have your taxes prepared in person or online. 

An easy-to-use virtual filing system allows you to work with IRS-certified tax preparers from the comfort of your home. Please see VITA's <a href="#Security">security protocol</a> and/or [watch a video](http://dar.to/35nkjju "watch a video") that explains their processes.
<br />
<br />

**Note:** One of the questions you will be asked is if you earn more than $66,000. Even if your income exceeds this amount, do not check this box. Virtual VITA will prepare your return irrespective of your income.

## Online Tax Preparation and Assistance
<br />

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6">

### How does this work?
You will complete the online intake survey which will ask you to fill out basic personal information, upload photos of your tax forms, and choose a preferred interview time.  

The tax preparers will strive to call you at a time of your choosing, but that cannot be guaranteed since it depends on counselor availability, that all paperwork was submitted, and other factors.  
<br />

</div>
<div class="col-md-6">

### Who is eligible for Virtual VITA?
At this time, VITA are able to assist people who are filing their current-year 2021 taxes as well as back taxes for the three prior years (2020, 2019 and 2018). In addition, they can amend returns for all 4 tax years.
