<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6">

**Important:** Tax Preparation and Assistance is now only available for those who don't owe any taxes. The tax helpers will work with you to file a tax extension. 

To reduce the spread of coronavirus, all in-person tax preparation and assistance locations had to close. To maintain some level of service, virtual tax assistance is being offered to those who still need to file. Please see VITA's <a href="#Security">security protocol</a>.

The group providing this tax preparation service is the same group of IRS-Certified Tax Preparers that has provided these services under AARP sponsorship for many years.

### How does this work?
Complete the online intake survey which will ask you to fill out basic personal information, upload photos of your tax forms, and choose an appointment time.

A VITA preparer will call you shortly after submission and let you know they have been assigned to your return. A second VITA preparer will check their work before filing.

<a name="Security"><h3>VITA Security Protocol</h3></a>
VITA can only implement best practices as no plan is 100% fail-safe, it is indeed of paramount importance that we use every available security protocol to provide the safest environment for our clients.

* VITA has [encrypted](https://dar.to/2xTGPCB "Encrypted") the form with a private key that will be shared ONLY by the IRS-Certified Group of Tax Preparers. 
* At the bottom of the welcome page, a message of "This Form is Encrypted" will show. This means that encryption has been enabled and that only individuals assigned the private key on their device will have access.
* The VITA Virtual Site Coordinator is responsible for giving out the keys and if there is any indication that an issue may arise, the Coordinator will issue new private keys immediately.
* VITA ensures that within a 24-hour period from the time we receive a submission to the time a final tax return is complete and filed, that the client's data is wiped clean from the form's secure database. Their goal is a swift turnaround, with no remaining data hanging around.
