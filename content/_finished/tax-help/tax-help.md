The service will be available both on-site at Darien Library and virtually through a secure internet site.

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6">

### How does this work?
You can access the virtual option by going to [SimplifyCT.org](https://dar.to/3Gha4xI "SimplifyCT.org") and following directions to the “Get Your Refund” (GYR) virtual site. On this highly encrypted site (like that used by banks and brokerage houses, see protocol below), you will be taken through a series of screens in which you will enter personal information and upload images of your tax forms. Once completed, you will receive a phone call from an IRS-certified volunteer who will the guide you through the rest of the process.
<br />
<br />

### What technology will I need?
You will need to access to a smartphone or a tablet with a camera, or a computer with a scanner.

<!-- ### Who is eligible for Virtual VITA?
At this time, VITA are able to assist people who are filing their current-year 2021 taxes as well as back taxes for the three prior years (2020, 2019 and 2018). In addition, they can amend returns for all 4 tax years. -->

### What is the security protocol?
While no data security plan is 100% fail-safe, the following SimplifyCT's security policy is in place to provide the safest environment for our clients:

* All taxpayer information sent to the GYR website is stored in an encrypted database protected from external networks.
* The website will not permit any network connections without strong encryption protocols.
* All connections are encrypted using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) certificates.
* Use of Google’s “Recaptcha” to protect against malicious bots.
* Utilization of a publicly registered domain name.
* Implementation of an incident response plan that includes reporting security incidents to the IRS.
