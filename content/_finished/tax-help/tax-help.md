## Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) is Virtual
<br />
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6">

The Virtual VITA Tax-Aide program at Darien Library returns this year with a few changes to ensure the safety of all. An easy-to-use virtual filing system allows you to work with IRS-certified tax preparers from the comfort of your home. Please see VITA's <a href="#Security">security protocol</a> and/or [watch a video](http://dar.to/35nkjju "watch a video") that explains their processes.
<br />
<br />

**Note:** One of the questions you will be asked is if you earn more than $66,000. Even if your income exceeds this amount, do not check this box. Virtual VITA will prepare your return irrespective of your income.

## Online Tax Preparation and Assistance
<br />

<div class="col-md-6">

### How does this work?
You will complete the online intake survey which will ask you to fill out basic personal information, upload photos of your tax forms, and choose a preferred interview time.  

The tax preparers will strive to call you at a time of your choosing, but that cannot be guaranteed since it depends on counselor availability, that all paperwork was submitted, and other factors.  
<br />

### Who is eligible for Virtual VITA?
At this time, VITA are able to assist people who are filing their current-year 2020 taxes as well as back taxes for the three prior years, (2019, 2018 and 2017). In addition, they can amend returns for all 4 tax years.

<div class="col-md-6">

### In-Person Appointments
We strongly encourage you to have your returns prepared using the all-virtual filing method.  

However, for those with minimal computer skills or who can’t elicit the help of family or friends, Darien Library will be offering limited in-person appointments by which your basic information and tax documents will be entered into the “Get Your Refund” system by the same group of IRS-certified volunteers we have partnered with for years. 

Due to COVID restrictions, this service is very limited and appointments are required. Your return will be prepared remotely by Virtual VITA volunteers and arrangements will be made to deliver the finished return to you at a later date.        
<br />
<br />
