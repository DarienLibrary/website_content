<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6">

The Virtual VITA Tax-Aide program at Darien Library returns this year with a few changes to ensure the safety of all. An easy-to-use virtual filing system allows you to work with IRS-certified tax preparers from the comfort of your home. Please see VITA's <a href="#Security">security protocol</a>.

**New This Year**<br />
You may pre-register for tax filing help between now and Monday, January 25th. By preregistering, you will be emailed a link to allow you to start filling out your request for assistance as soon as registration opens. This is a handy reminder service to get you started on your taxes as soon as possible!

### How does this work?
When registration opens on January 25th, you will complete the online intake survey which will ask you to fill out basic personal information, upload photos of your tax forms, and choose an appointment time.

A VITA preparer will call you shortly after submission and let you know they have been assigned to your return. A second VITA preparer will check their work before filing.

### Who is eligible for Virtual VITA?
At this time, VITA can only assist people who are filing their current year 2020 taxes. Also, we can only help those with either a smartphone or computer and reliable WiFi. 

If you need to amend a a tax return that has already been filed, or need to file taxes for 2019 or earlier, VITA recommends using the [My Free Taxes](https://dar.to/393hgMt "My Free Taxes") service.

<div class="col-md-6">

### In-Person Appointments
We strongly encourage you to have your returns prepared using the all-virtual filing method.  

However, for those with minimal computer skills or who can’t elicit the help of family or friends, Darien Library will be offering limited in-person appointments by which your basic information and tax documents will be entered into the “Get Your Refund” system by the same group of IRS-certified volunteers we have partnered with for years. 

Due to COVID restrictions, this service is very limited and appointments are required. Your return will be prepared remotely by Virtual VITA volunteers and arrangements will be made to deliver the finished return to you at a later date.

## VITA Security Protocol
VITA can only implement best practices as no plan is 100% fail-safe, it is indeed of paramount importance that we use every available security protocol to provide the safest environment for our clients.

* VITA has [encrypted](https://dar.to/2xTGPCB "Encrypted") the form with a private key that will be shared ONLY by the IRS-Certified Group of Tax Preparers. 
* At the bottom of the welcome page, a message of "This Form is Encrypted" will show. This means that encryption has been enabled and that only individuals assigned the private key on their device will have access.
* The VITA Virtual Site Coordinator is responsible for giving out the keys and if there is any indication that an issue may arise, the Coordinator will issue new private keys immediately.
* VITA ensures that within a 24-hour period from the time we receive a submission to the time a final tax return is complete and filed, that the client's data is wiped clean from the form's secure database. Their goal is a swift turnaround, with no remaining data hanging around.
