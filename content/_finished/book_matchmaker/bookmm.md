Are you always on the look-out for a great book? Do you find yourself regularly searching for authors and titles just like your favorites? Darien Libraryâ€™s new Book Matchmaker is here to help. Powered by [NoveList](/search?search=NoveList&filter=ResearchResource "NoveList"), a premiere book database, our service will help match you to books by genre and appeal, as well as discover new books by looking up your favorite authors and titles. You can find the Book Matchmaker on Main Street next to the Welcome Desk. Your librarians will be delighted to give you a demonstration of this new service.
