### Thank you for supporting Darien Library!

All gifts to the Annual Fund are dedicated directly to library resources, including all of the books, DVDs, technology, learning resources, and programs for children, teens, and adults. The Annual Fund is a crucial ingredient of our success, since these funds are added to the operating income we generously receive from the Town.

Our current fiscal year runs from July 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020 and any donation amount is appreciated. All donations are also tax-deductible.

Please enjoy the special message video from us to you.
