This report shows why Darien Library is one of the most successful libraries in the nation.

It is a leader in providing innovative services, a broad and deep collection of books, DVDs, magazines, technology, programs and research databases, all housed in a welcoming building, staffed by a warm, friendly and amazingly helpful staff of extraordinary librarians.

The support we receive from you is fundamental to all this. The Town of Darien provides for the building and its operation, and for staff members and benefits. But your donations to the Annual Fund provide our collection, our programs, our online resources, and our technology — everything, apart from staff, that makes this library something special. It is because of you that we can serve the community so well.

I’ve asked the Department Heads to summarize last year’s activities on the following pages and I think you will be able to see why — with the range and complexity of all that they and their fellow librarians do – your support is so valuable.Thank you for being a Friend of Darien Library.

It’s no wonder Darien Library is the most actively used Library in the state!
