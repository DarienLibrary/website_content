Darien Library is home to four 3D printers: [MakerBot Z18](http://store.makerbot.com/replicator-z18 "MakerBot Z18"), [MakerBot Replicator 5th Generation](http://store.makerbot.com/replicator "MakerBot Replicator 5th Generation"), [MakerBot Replicator 2]( "MakerBot Replicator 2"), and a [Form 1 3D Printer](/link-needed to page on website "Form 1 3D Printer"). 


[ADD COLLAPISBLE FIELD HERE WITH INFORMATION ABOUT EACH OF THE 3D PRINTER TYPES. GET TEXT FOR FORM 1 FROM http://www.darienlibrary.org/services/form1]

A 3D printer is a machine that takes digital files and produces a plastic print-out of your design. The arrival of 3D printers allows anyone to create physical models their own designs without the need to send out to a special manufacturer. Learn more about 3D printers. If you would like to see a 3D printer, come down to the Help Desk located in the computer labs on the Lower Level.

This exciting new technology will continue to improve in the years to come. Therefore when you request an object to be printed, please keep in mind that sometimes the machines will be unavailable due to repairs.

#Printing Objects
3D objects can be printed from something you designed yourself or downloaded from a site like [Thingiverse](http://thingiverse.com/ "Thingiverse"). You can use software like [Tinkercad](http://tinkercad.com/ "Tinkercad") or [SketchUp](http://www.sketchup.com/ "SketchUp") to create your designs. While staff members are unable to show you how to create designs, you can teach yourself using our access to [Lynda.com](/link-needed "Lynda.com").

Submit your print request to [helpdesk@darienlibrary.org](mailto:helpdesk@darienlibrary.org "Help Desk") (15mb attachment limit), or send an Internet link to the object along with the exact specifications, otherwise bring it in to your Help Desk on a flash drive or other media.

Print time is up to 3 days from submission.

#Cost to Print
Similar to other services in the Library like printing and photocopying, 3D printing is a service that charges a fee for your printed object. We charge by weight in grams. We will give you an estimate of how much the final object will cost. We include the weight of the supports and rafts in the cost. Therefore, we cannot give an exact cost at the time of the print order. The Form1 printer costs more since it produces a higher quality print.

Children who live in Darien and are 12 and under may use the 3D printer in the Children's Library at no cost.
* Form1: 25 cents per gram
* Other 3D printers: 10 cents per gram
* Minimum charge: $2
