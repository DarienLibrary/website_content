#DNA Testing
"A genealogical DNA test looks at a person's genetic code at specific locations. Results give information about genealogy or personal ancestry. In general, these tests compare the results of an individual to others from the same lineage or to current and historic groups. The test results are not meant for medical use, where different types of genetic testing are needed. They do not determine specific genetic diseases or disorders. They are intended only to give genealogical information." [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genealogical_DNA_test "Genealogical DNA Testing")

A local genealogist told us,

"If someone were to ask my advice, I would say do Y-chromosome DNA testing because it is inherited male to male like surnames. I would say use Family Tree DNA because they are biggest and have public results pages for surnames and DNA types. Test at least 67 markers. Test yourself if you are a male, and any male relative whose distant ancestry you want to learn more about. I would warn that you are not very likely to find people for your family tree because only a very small percentage of people have had their DNA tested. And there is a chance that you will learn very little because the person tested has an uncommon DNA type."
