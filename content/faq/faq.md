#Check Out Items
*Can I get a library card?*
Sure! If you live in Darien, bring to the Welcome Desk something which has your Darien address on it (e.g. a piece of mail, your license, lease/mortgage agreement, etc.). If you work in Darien full-time, bring your pay stub or a letter from your employer to verify your employment. Friends at the $300 level or above automatically get a Non-Resident Member card. 

*I don't live in Darien. Can I check out books here?*
Absolutely! Just bring your hometown library card in to the Welcome Desk. We will then register you in our system. If you want to access eBooks and other digital content, you will need to check with your hometown library or become a [Friend of the Library](/link-needed "Friend of the Library").

*Where do I pick up my holds?*
There is an area behind the Welcome Desk for your holds. Just walk past the desk and into the space to the left full of shelves. You'll find your items by your last name. 

*Do I have to check out items placed on hold for me?* 
Yes, please check your items at the self checkouts. 

*Can I renew this item?*
Generally yes. Items which have other people waiting on them may not be renewed. You can put another request on it to finish it later. 14 day books (described below) are not renewable. 

*What makes 14 day books different?*
14 days are the hottest books in our collection! To get them into your hands as quickly as possible, they are treated a little different. You can check out a 14 day book for....14 days! You may not place a hold on one of these books or renew them. If you want to enjoy your book longer, borrow a book which does not have the 14 day label on the spine. 

You'll find 14 days on our Main Level straight across from where you enter the Library from the parking lot.

*How do I return items?*
Pull into the Library's driveway from Post Road. The 24/7 book drop **** how do you write this? **** is located between the Library and the parking lot. If you are coming into the building from the parking lot side, the book returns are in the entry way. 

*Where are the large type books?*
On the Main Level, make a left at the Welcome Desk and walk through the stacks all the way to the fireplace. The large type books surround this comfortable reading space.

#Digital Content
We offer a wide variety of digital content: eBooks, eMagazines, Movies, Music, TV Shows, and Comics. Visit the [Digital](/link-needed "Digital") page to learn more.

#Fines
*Why do I have a fine on my account?*
Oh no! We're sorry to hear that. Fines are caused by three things: 
* Item not returned on time
* Item is lost or returned missing a part (like a CD)
* Item is damaged (this is a replacement fee)

The Library attempts to keep you aware of when your items are due by: 
* Offering a checkout slip which lists the due date
* Sending you email reminders
* Listing your checked out items on your website account

If you need a receipt of what you checked out, please see the Welcome Desk.

*Where do I pay my fine?*
Please pay at the Welcome Desk. 

*What does a fine stop me from doing?*
Once you owe $50, you will be unable to checkout items or use a computer. Please get the amount under $50 to resume using the Library's services.

*Why don't seniors have fines?*
To acknowledge the many years of contribution and service that our senior patrons have made to the Library, we waive overdue fees on items for patrons 65 years and older. Those who still want to pay overdue fees are welcome to make a contribution!
