*How do I print?*
You can print in three ways: 

* Sign onto a Library computer on the Lower Level, in the Children's Library, or on the Second Level. 
* Visit the [Mobile Print Service](https://www.printeron.net/system/printspot/interface/select_file.jsp?url=dl/main&protocolSwitched=true "Mobile Print Service") page to upload your document.
* Email your document from your laptop or phone to the wireless printer. For black and white prints, send your document to dl-main-bw@printspots.com or send color documents to dl-main-color@printspots.com

*Where do I pick up prints?*

If you email or upload your document, you will need to visit the Second Level's Wireless Print Release station. Once you log in and release the document for printing, you can pick it up at the printer.  *** NEED BETTER DIRECTIONS ***

#Scanning
Scanning is available on the Lower Level in the [Business Center](/link-needed "Business Center") and on the Second Level. 

* *Scan to Email:* Use the scanners in the Business Center or the Reference Room to scan your documents to email. The file will be sent as a PDF.
* *Scan Books:* Great for students, the KIC Book Scanner on the Second Level makes it easy to scan your notebook to share your notes. The file will be sent as a PDF.
* *Scan Photos:* Use a flatbed scanner to digitize your photos. If you have a lot of photos, the [Digital Media Lab](/link-needed "Digital Media Lab") may be a better option.

#Meeting Rooms
*Can I get a study room right now?* 
If a room is available, of course! All we ask is that you have a library card registered in our system. 

*Can I get a study room later?*
Yes, if you live in Darien, work full-time in Darien, or are a Friend of the Library. If you are a non-resident, you will need to become a [Friend](/link-needed "Friend of the Library") to book a room in advance. 


#Food & Drinks
*Where is the water fountain?*
We have three water fountains located throughout the building. One by the Cafe, another by the bathrooms on the Lower Level, and one on the Mezzanine Level by the bathrooms.


#Quiet Places
The Library is a busy place with people using the space in different ways. If you want a quiet place to work, our recommendations: 

**** ADD A LINK TO A MAP TO THESE PLACES ***

* *Quiet Study Rooms:* Ask the Reference Librarian on the Second Level to schedule you. This is a no-talking space for up to two people.
* *First Floor Fireplace:* In the winter months, relax and enjoy a soothing fire. Find the fireplace behind the fiction shelves to the left when you enter the building from the parking lot. 
* *Magazine, Art, Business Sections, and Classics Room:* Onn the Second Level, head towards the far left side of the building (towards Darien, not the cemetery). Enjoy a whole area devoted to quiet time.

#iPads
iPads and other technology gadgets may be borrowed by Darien residents, those who work full-time in Darien, and [Friends of the Library](/link-needed "Friend of the Library") who have donated $300 or more per year. iPads are loaned out for 7 days. 

* *Children:* [Early Literacy iPads](/link-needed "Early Literacy iPads") from the Children's Library will help your child learn to read.
* *Adults & Teens:* Borrow iPads with apps focused on art and cooking from the Welcome Desk. Or if you want a general iPad for work, borrow one from the Help Desk on the Lower Level.
