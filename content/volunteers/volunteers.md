Darien Library is fortunate to have a loyal corps of dedicated volunteers. Some of our volunteer opportunities include:

*Book Wrangler:* Help keep our shelves neat, hunt for missing books, and help us assure that our books are easy to find!

*Library Loudspeaker:* Have interest or experience in marketing? Are you an excellent writer? Help draft press releases, brainstorm promotional ideas, and make sure that everyone in town knows what is going on at the library!

*Book Agent:* Sort and orgainse our discarded books to be prepped for sale! You'll assist in setting up for our book sales, taking payment, and assuring everything runs smoothly.

*Web Doctor:* Help clean up our website by deleting spam, fixing broken links, and getting rid of outdated information. Our Web Doctors are comfortable with computers and technology.

*Digitization Wizard:* Bring our paper materials into the 21st Century! Digitization Wizards will scan materials and help us make them accessible digitally.

*Community Readers' Adviser:* Love to talk about books? Have you seen a great movie recently? Write reviews and rate materials on our website.  

*Videographer Assistant:* Aid our Videographer as he films documentaries right here at the library!

*Neat and Tidy Committee:* Are you organized? Does everything have its exact place? Do your friends think you're a little neurotic? Help us sort through our stuff!  We need volunteers to organize and straighten our behind-the-scenes materials.

*Library Farmer:* Have a green thumb? We're looking for a volunteer to help us tend to our vegetable garden and organize our Seed Library.

We are happy to work with you to create a volunteer position that will match your interests and talents with our volunteer opportunities.
