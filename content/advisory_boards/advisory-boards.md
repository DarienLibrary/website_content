#Kids Advisory Board


#Teen Advisory Board
Our teen advisors are ambassadors to their schools on behalf of the Library. The advisors generate buzz and excitement for teen events — programs they helped plan. Teens gain leadership and project management skills. They have lots of great ideas and have a special place in their hearts for the Library and all it has to offer. 

#Senior Advisory Board
The Senior Advisory Board advocates for the needs and services of elder adults in the community. Their accomplishments include creating and maintaining the Community Bulletin Board and planning our monthly series, “Senior Moments." Each coffee and conversation group is a chance for for seniors to get together in the community. Past events have included line dancing for seniors, the history of Grand Central Terminal, origami ornaments, and Animal House: a Petting Zoo Just for Adults.



#Trustees Advisory Board
Trustees are elected members of the community who serve on the Library's Board of Trustees. The Board's guidance led to success of our capitol fundraising for the current library's location and new building. Each year, the Board raises funds for the purchase of all new materials and to fund programming and events. [View the list of trustees](/link-needed "Board of Trustees").
