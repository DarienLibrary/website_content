Do you need your paperwork notarized? Our Notary Publics are available to notarize your documents free of charge. We try to have a Notary in the building at all times. Please call ahead on the weekends to check for a Notary.

_A Notary Public is a public servant appointed by state government to witness the signing of important documents and administer oaths._ 

If you need something notarized, please bring two forms of ID containing your signature, one of which must have a photo.

#Examples of acceptable IDs:
* Valid driverâ€™s license
* Passport
* Credit card 

Please don't sign the document(s) until you appear before the Notary Public.
